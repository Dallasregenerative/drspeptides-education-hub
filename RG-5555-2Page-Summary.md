## Mechanism of Action

### Comprehensive Healing Through Four Synergistic Pathways:

- **BPC-157:**
  - Promotes nitric oxide synthesis, enhances growth factor production, and provides tissue repair and gastroprotection.

- **TB-500:**
  - Binds G-actin, facilitates cell migration, promotes angiogenesis, and reduces scar formation.

- **KPV:**
  - Suppresses inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB), modulates immune responses, and supports gut barrier function.

- **Larazotide:**
  - Antagonizes zonulin, stabilizes tight junctions, and restores intestinal barrier integrity.

**Synergistic Effects:** The combination provides comprehensive healing support, addressing tissue repair, inflammation control, immune modulation, and barrier protection simultaneously—creating superior outcomes compared to individual peptides.

## Safety Profile & Contraindications

### Excellent Individual Safety Profiles
- All peptides demonstrate good safety in research studies.
- Enteric coating minimizes GI side effects.
- High doses require monitoring but are generally well-tolerated.

### Absolute Contraindications
- Pregnancy and lactation.
- Active cancer or a history of cancer.
- Severe liver or kidney dysfunction.

### Requires Medical Supervision
- **Autoimmune disorders:** May alter immune responses.
- **Bleeding disorders:** TB-500’s angiogenic effects may increase bleeding risk.
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Monitor in severe conditions.
- **Immunosuppressive medications:** Potential interactions.

### Key Drug Interactions
- **Immunosuppressive drugs:** Monitor for enhanced/competing effects.
- **Anti-inflammatory medications:** May be additive.
- **Anticoagulants:** Increased bleeding risk potential.
