## Mechanism of Action

### Comprehensive Healing Through Four Synergistic Pathways:

**BPC-157 (Tissue Repair & Angiogenesis):**
- A pentadecapeptide derived from human gastric juice, BPC-157 is a master healing agent. It promotes nitric oxide synthesis, enhancing blood flow and nutrient delivery to injured tissues. It also upregulates growth factor expression (VEGF, EGF) to accelerate tissue regeneration and provides potent cytoprotection, safeguarding tissues from injury. It has been shown to accelerate the healing of muscle, tendon, ligament, and bone.

**TB-500 (Actin Remodeling & Cell Migration):**
- A synthetic version of Thymosin Beta-4, TB-500 is a key regulator of actin, a critical component of the cell cytoskeleton. It binds G-actin, facilitating actin polymerization and cytoskeletal remodeling, which is essential for cell migration. It promotes the migration of endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts to injury sites, reduces scar formation and fibrosis through balanced collagen deposition, and enhances angiogenesis and tissue regeneration.

**KPV (Anti-inflammatory & Immune Modulation):**
- The C-terminal fragment of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), KPV is a potent anti-inflammatory peptide. It suppresses inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB) through intracellular signaling pathways, modulates immune responses by promoting a pro-healing M2 macrophage phenotype, and supports gut barrier function by reducing intestinal inflammation.

**Larazotide (Gut Barrier Integrity):**
- An octapeptide that acts as a zonulin antagonist, Larazotide is the only drug in its class to have completed Phase III clinical trials. Zonulin is the primary regulator of intestinal tight junction permeability. By antagonizing zonulin, Larazotide stabilizes tight junctions, preventing leaky gut and reducing the systemic inflammation that originates from a compromised gut barrier. It restores intestinal barrier integrity and function, which is foundational for overall health and recovery.

**Synergistic Integration:** The combination provides comprehensive healing support by addressing tissue repair (BPC-157, TB-500), inflammation control (KPV), immune modulation (KPV, TB-500), and gut barrier protection (Larazotide, KPV)—simultaneously creating superior outcomes compared to individual peptides.
