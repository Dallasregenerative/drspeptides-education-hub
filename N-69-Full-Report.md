**PHYSICIAN USE ONLY | RESEARCH PEPTIDES**

*Last Updated: February 5, 2026*

## 1. Composition & Overview

**Formula Classification:** Multi-pathway neuro-hormonal and vascular sexual function modulator – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**
- N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) – 100 mg
- Kisspeptin – 0.5 mg
- PT-141 (Bremelanotide) – 0.5 mg
- Oxytocin – 1 mg
- Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) – 0.25 mg

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for on-demand use, designed to protect peptide integrity and ensure optimal absorption for pre-intercourse administration.

**Therapeutic Intent:**
- To provide a comprehensive solution for both male and female sexual dysfunction by simultaneously targeting the central (desire, arousal) and peripheral (vascular, sensory) pathways of the sexual response cycle. This formula is designed to enhance libido, improve physical function, and deepen emotional intimacy.

## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

Formula N-69 integrates five synergistic components to orchestrate a complete and robust sexual response.

### 2.1 NALT: Catecholamine Precursor

NALT provides the essential building block for dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters crucial for motivation, focus, and energy during sexual activity [1].

### 2.2 Kisspeptin: HPG Axis & Limbic System Activation

Kisspeptin acts as a master switch for the reproductive axis, stimulating GnRH release and subsequent sex hormone production. Crucially, it also directly activates limbic brain regions associated with sexual arousal and mood, enhancing the psychological component of desire [2].

### 2.3 PT-141 (Bremelanotide): Central Melanocortin Arousal

PT-141 works directly on the brain's melanocortin system to induce spontaneous arousal, independent of external stimuli. It is FDA-approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women and is effective for psychogenic erectile dysfunction in men [3].

### 2.4 Oxytocin: Neuro-hormonal Bonding & Orgasmic Enhancement

Oxytocin enhances feelings of connection and trust, reducing performance anxiety. It also plays a direct physiological role by promoting nitric oxide (NO) synthesis for erectile function and increasing the intensity of orgasm [4].

### 2.5 VIP: Peripheral Vasodilation

VIP is a potent vasodilator that ensures maximal blood flow to erectile tissues by inducing smooth muscle relaxation, leading to firm erections and clitoral engorgement [5].

## 3. Synergistic Integration Table

| Level | Primary Pathway | Key Components | Integrated Clinical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Central Desire | HPG Axis & Limbic Activation | Kisspeptin, PT-141 | Potent, spontaneous increase in libido and sexual thoughts. |
| Central Arousal | Neurotransmitter & Bonding | NALT, Oxytocin | Enhanced focus, motivation, and feelings of intimacy; reduced performance anxiety. |
| Peripheral Function | Vascular & Smooth Muscle | VIP, Oxytocin | Maximal blood flow to erectile tissues for firm erections and clitoral engorgement. |
| Orgasmic Response | Sensory & Contractile | Oxytocin, VIP | Increased intensity and pleasure of orgasm. |

## 4. Key Clinical Benefits

| Domain | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| Libido & Desire | Significant increase in spontaneous sexual desire and thoughts for both men and women. |
| Physical Function | Improved erectile quality and sustainability; enhanced vaginal lubrication and clitoral sensitivity. |
| Orgasmic Quality | Increased frequency, intensity, and pleasure of orgasm. |
| Emotional Intimacy | Enhanced feelings of connection, trust, and bonding with a partner. |

## 5. Patient Expectations & Timeline

| Timeframe | Expected Changes |
|---|---|
| 30-90 Minutes | Initial feelings of warmth, flushing, and increased awareness of tactile sensations. Spontaneous sexual thoughts and desire may begin. |
| 1-3 Hours | Peak effects. Strong desire, enhanced arousal, and robust physical response to stimuli. Optimal window for sexual activity. |
| 3-8 Hours | Effects gradually subside, though a heightened sense of connection and well-being may persist. |

## 6. Dosing & Administration

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule taken 1-2 hours before anticipated sexual activity.
- **Timing:** Take on an empty stomach for fastest absorption. Effects are dose-dependent and can be titrated under medical supervision.
- **Frequency:** Use as needed. Not intended for daily use.

---

## 7. Safety Profile

- **Overall:** Generally well-tolerated for on-demand use.
- **Absolute Contraindications:** Pregnancy and lactation; severe, unstable cardiovascular disease.
- **Relative Cautions:** Controlled hypertension (monitor BP); use with other vasodilators (e.g., PDE5 inhibitors) requires dose adjustment and medical supervision.
- **Tolerability:** The most common side effects are transient and related to PT-141: facial flushing (common, usually mild), nausea (dose-dependent, often improves with use), and headache. VIP can cause a brief, mild drop in blood pressure.

## 8. Drug Interaction Considerations

| Drug/Class | Interaction / Management |
|---|---|
| PDE5 Inhibitors (e.g., Sildenafil) | Additive hypotensive effects. Combination should only be used under strict medical supervision with dose reduction of both agents. |
| Antihypertensives | Potential for additive hypotension. Monitor blood pressure. |
| Dopaminergic Agents | Potential for additive effects; use with caution. |
