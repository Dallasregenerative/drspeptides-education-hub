## 1. COMPOSITION & OVERVIEW

Formula N-111 is a next-generation cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective protocol that combines three powerful, synergistic nootropic agents. It is designed to enhance cognitive function through multiple, complementary mechanisms, including mitochondrial optimization, structural synaptogenesis, and rapid neurochemical modulation.

| Component | Dosage | Primary Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **J147** | 10 mg | Mitochondrial ATP Synthase Modulation & AMPK Activation |
| **Dihexa** | 10 mg | HGF/c-Met System Activation & Structural Synaptogenesis |
| **Noopept** | 10 mg | AMPA Receptor Modulation & Neurotrophin Expression |

This triple-target formulation provides both immediate cognitive benefits and long-term structural improvements to neural networks, making it a powerful tool for addressing age-related cognitive decline and enhancing peak cognitive performance.

## 2. DETAILED MECHANISM OF ACTION

Formula N-111's efficacy stems from its multi-faceted approach, targeting cellular energy, neural structure, and neurochemical signaling simultaneously.

### 2.1 J147: Mitochondrial Optimization & Longevity

J147 is a novel neurotrophic compound with potent anti-aging and neuroprotective properties. Its primary target is the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase, a key enzyme in cellular energy production [1].

- **ATP Synthase Modulation:** By binding to the ATP synthase, J147 induces a modest, sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels. This triggers the activation of the CAMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway, a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and longevity [2].
- **Neurotrophic Factor Induction:** J147 has been shown to significantly increase the expression of key neurotrophic factors, including Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which are critical for neuronal survival, growth, and plasticity [3].
- **Neuroprotection:** It protects neurons from multiple forms of age-associated toxicity, including excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, and has demonstrated the ability to reverse cognitive impairment in aged Alzheimer's disease mouse models.

### 2.2 Dihexa: Structural Synaptogenesis

Dihexa is a highly potent, blood-brain barrier-permeable angiotensin IV analog. Its primary mechanism involves the potentiation of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling system, a critical pathway for neuronal development and repair [4].

- **HGF/c-Met Activation:** Dihexa binds to HGF with high affinity, augmenting its ability to activate its receptor, c-Met. This activation is a powerful trigger for synaptogenesis—the formation of new synapses between neurons.
- **Potency:** While early claims of being millions of times more potent than BDNF are based on a retracted study, Dihexa remains an exceptionally powerful synaptogenic agent, capable of inducing significant increases in dendritic spine density and promoting the formation of new functional neural connections [5].
- **Cognitive Rescue:** In animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Dihexa has been shown to rescue cognitive impairment and recover memory by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway downstream of c-Met, which is crucial for cell survival and plasticity [4].

### 2.3 Noopept: Rapid Neurotransmitter Optimization

Noopept (N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester) is a fast-acting nootropic dipeptide with both cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective effects.

- **AMPA Receptor Modulation:** Noopept acts as a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, a type of glutamate receptor that mediates fast synaptic transmission. By enhancing AMPA receptor function, Noopept facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory [6].
- **Neurotrophin Expression:** Similar to J147, Noopept stimulates the expression of NGF and BDNF in the hippocampus, contributing to long-term neuroplasticity and neuronal resilience [7].
- **Rapid Onset:** The effects of Noopept are often felt within 15-30 minutes of administration, providing an immediate boost in cognitive clarity and processing speed.

### 2.4 Synergistic Architecture

The combination of J147, Dihexa, and Noopept creates a powerful synergy. J147 optimizes the underlying cellular energy environment. Dihexa provides the structural framework for new learning by building new synaptic connections. Noopept then enhances the efficiency of signal transmission across these new and existing connections. This results in rapid cognitive enhancement, lasting structural changes, and robust, multi-pathway neuroprotection.

## 4. DOSING, ADMINISTRATION & SAFETY

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Administration:** Can be taken with or without food. Consistent daily use is recommended for optimal long-term benefits.
- **Safety Profile:** All three components have been studied in animal models and have demonstrated favorable safety profiles. J147 has successfully completed a Phase 1 human safety trial. Noopept has over 20 years of clinical use in Russia and Eastern Europe.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy/lactation; known hypersensitivity.
