# Formula W-1175: Advanced Metabolic Health Support

**PHYSICIAN USE ONLY | RESEARCH PEPTIDES**

*Last Updated: February 5, 2026*

---

## 1. Composition & Overview

**Formula Classification:** Dual-pathway metabolic modulator – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**
- SLU-PP-332 – 10 mg
- Orforglipron – 10 mg

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for daily use, designed to ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability of both components.

**Therapeutic Intent:**
- To provide a powerful, synergistic approach to weight management and metabolic health by simultaneously targeting two key regulatory pathways: incretin-based appetite suppression (Orforglipron) and exercise-mimetic energy expenditure (SLU-PP-332). This formula is designed for individuals seeking significant weight loss and improvement in metabolic parameters like insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.

## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

Formula W-1175 integrates two cutting-edge metabolic agents that work in concert to create a powerful weight loss and health-promoting effect.

### 2.1 SLU-PP-332: Pharmacological Exercise Mimicry

SLU-PP-332 is a pan-agonist of the Estrogen-Related Receptors (ERRs), which are master regulators of cellular energy metabolism. By activating these receptors, SLU-PP-332 induces a gene expression profile that mimics the effects of endurance exercise, including increased fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and resting energy expenditure [1].

### 2.2 Orforglipron: Oral GLP-1 Receptor Agonism

Orforglipron is a potent, oral, non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor. It suppresses appetite, enhances insulin secretion, and slows gastric emptying, leading to reduced caloric intake and improved glycemic control. It has demonstrated weight loss of up to 14.7% in clinical trials [2, 3].

## 3. Synergistic Integration Table

| Level | Primary Pathway | Key Components | Integrated Clinical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caloric Intake | Appetite & Satiety Regulation | Orforglipron | Potent, sustained appetite suppression leading to a significant reduction in caloric intake. |
| Caloric Expenditure | Energy Expenditure & Fuel Utilization | SLU-PP-332 | Increased resting energy expenditure and a metabolic shift towards fat oxidation, effectively burning more calories at rest. |
| Metabolic Health | Insulin Sensitivity & Glycemic Control | Orforglipron, SLU-PP-332 | Improved insulin sensitivity, better glycemic control, and favorable changes in lipid profiles. |

## 4. Key Clinical Benefits

| Domain | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| Weight Loss | Significant and sustained weight loss, with a mean reduction approaching 15% or more. |
| Body Composition | Preferential loss of fat mass with relative preservation of lean muscle mass. |
| Metabolic Health | Improved insulin sensitivity, lower HbA1c, and improved lipid profiles. |
| Appetite Control | Potent and sustained reduction in appetite and food cravings. |

---

## 5. Patient Expectations & Timeline

| Timeframe | Expected Changes |
|---|---|
| 1-7 Days | Initial reduction in appetite and food cravings. Some patients may experience mild, transient GI side effects. |
| 1-4 Weeks | Consistent appetite suppression and noticeable weight loss. |
| 1-3 Months | Significant weight loss and improvements in metabolic markers. |
| 3-6+ Months | Achievement of target weight loss goals and long-term maintenance of metabolic health benefits. |

## 6. Dosing & Administration

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Timing:** Can be taken with or without food. Consistent daily timing is recommended.
- **Optimization:** Start with a lower dose or every-other-day dosing to assess GI tolerance to Orforglipron.

## 7. Safety Profile

- **Overall:** A powerful metabolic formula that requires medical supervision.
- **Absolute Contraindications:** Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2); pregnancy and lactation.
- **Relative Cautions:** History of pancreatitis or gastroparesis.
- **Tolerability:** The most common side effects are GI-related (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and are typically mild to moderate and transient. SLU-PP-332 has a favorable preclinical safety profile, but long-term human data is not yet available.

## 8. Drug Interaction Considerations

| Drug/Class | Interaction / Management |
|---|---|
| Oral Medications | Orforglipron slows gastric emptying, which may affect the absorption of other oral drugs. Separate administration by at least 1 hour. |
| Antidiabetic Agents | Increased risk of hypoglycemia; may require dose reduction of other agents. |
