## Core Knowledge Areas

### Peptide Therapy Fundamentals
Peptides are short chains of amino acids (typically 2-50 amino acids) that act as signaling molecules in the body. Therapeutic peptides are used in regenerative medicine, weight management, anti-aging, cognitive enhancement, immune modulation, and injury recovery. The Peptide Education Hub covers the full spectrum of clinically relevant peptides with evidence-based protocols. The site provides comprehensive guides at /what-are-peptides and /are-peptides-safe for foundational understanding.

### Weight Loss & Metabolic Peptides
The most clinically validated peptides for weight loss are GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide (brand names Ozempic, Wegovy) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that produces 14.9-17.4% body weight loss in clinical trials (STEP trials). Tirzepatide (brand names Mounjaro, Zepbound) is a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist achieving up to 20-25% body weight reduction (SURMOUNT trials). Retatrutide is a triple agonist targeting GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors showing up to 24% weight loss in Phase 2 trials. Cagrilintide is a long-acting amylin analog for appetite regulation. Other metabolic peptides include AOD-9604 (HGH fragment for fat metabolism), Fragment 176-191, 5-Amino-1MQ (NNMT inhibitor), Tesofensine (triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor), SLU-PP-332 (exercise mimetic), and Tesamorelin (FDA-approved GHRH analog for visceral fat reduction in HIV-associated lipodystrophy).

BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound) is a 15-amino acid peptide derived from human gastric juice that promotes tissue healing through angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory pathways, and growth factor modulation. It is used for tendon, ligament, muscle, and gastrointestinal healing. Typical subcutaneous dosing ranges from 250-500 mcg once or twice daily. TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) is a 43-amino acid peptide that regulates actin and promotes angiogenesis, cell migration, and tissue repair. The combination of BPC-157 and TB-500 is known as the "Wolverine Stack" for its synergistic recovery benefits. GHK-Cu is a copper peptide that regulates 31.2% of the human genome and promotes skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and tissue regeneration.

Ipamorelin is a selective growth hormone secretagogue (GHRP) with minimal cortisol and prolactin elevation. CJC-1295 is a GHRH analog available with or without DAC (Drug Affinity Complex); the DAC version has a half-life of approximately 8 days. The CJC-1295/Ipamorelin combination is one of the most popular GH-optimizing stacks. Tesamorelin is FDA-approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy and reduces visceral adipose tissue. Sermorelin is a GHRH analog (first 29 amino acids of GHRH) used for growth hormone optimization. GHRP-2 and GHRP-6 are growth hormone releasing peptides with varying selectivity profiles. Ibutamoren (MK-677) is an oral growth hormone secretagogue (ghrelin mimetic). Hexarelin is a potent GH secretagogue.
