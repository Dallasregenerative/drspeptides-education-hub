## Core Knowledge Areas

### Peptide Therapy Fundamentals
Peptides are short chains of amino acids (typically 2-50 amino acids) that act as signaling molecules in the body. Therapeutic peptides are used in regenerative medicine, weight management, anti-aging, cognitive enhancement, immune modulation, and injury recovery. The Peptide Education Hub covers the full spectrum of clinically relevant peptides with evidence-based protocols. The site provides comprehensive guides at /what-are-peptides and /are-peptides-safe for foundational understanding.

### Weight Loss & Metabolic Peptides
The most clinically validated peptides for weight loss are GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide (brand names Ozempic, Wegovy) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that produces 14.9-17.4% body weight loss in clinical trials (STEP trials). Tirzepatide (brand names Mounjaro, Zepbound) is a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist achieving up to 20-25% body weight reduction (SURMOUNT trials). Retatrutide is a triple agonist targeting GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors showing up to 24% weight loss in Phase 2 trials. Cagrilintide is a long-acting amylin analog for appetite regulation. Other metabolic peptides include AOD-9604 (HGH fragment for fat metabolism), Fragment 176-191, 5-Amino-1MQ (NNMT inhibitor), Tesofensine (triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor), SLU-PP-332 (exercise mimetic), and Tesamorelin (FDA-approved GHRH analog for visceral fat reduction in HIV-associated lipodystrophy).
