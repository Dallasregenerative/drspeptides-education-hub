*Published: February 8, 2026 | Peptide Education Hub | 15 min read*

Peptide reconstitution is one of the most fundamental skills in peptide therapy, yet it remains a frequent source of confusion for both new practitioners and patients. This comprehensive guide covers everything healthcare providers need to know about properly reconstituting lyophilized peptides for clinical use, including step-by-step protocols, dosage calculations, storage requirements, and common mistakes to avoid.

## What Is Peptide Reconstitution?

Peptide reconstitution refers to the process of dissolving lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptide powder into a liquid solvent to create an injectable solution. Most therapeutic peptides are shipped as lyophilized powders because this form is significantly more stable during shipping and storage than liquid formulations. The freeze-drying process removes water while preserving the peptide's three-dimensional structure and biological activity.

When a practitioner or patient receives a vial of lyophilized peptide, it must be reconstituted with an appropriate solvent before it can be administered. The reconstitution process, while straightforward, requires attention to detail to ensure the peptide maintains its potency and sterility.

## Why Proper Reconstitution Matters

Improper reconstitution can lead to several clinical problems that directly affect patient outcomes:

| Issue | Cause | Clinical Impact |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Loss of potency | Vigorous shaking, excessive heat | Reduced therapeutic effect |
| Bacterial contamination | Non-sterile technique | Infection risk at injection site |
| Inaccurate dosing | Incorrect solvent volume | Under- or over-dosing |
| Peptide aggregation | Wrong solvent or pH | Immune reactions, reduced efficacy |
| Degradation | Improper storage post-reconstitution | Progressive loss of activity |

## Choosing the Right Solvent

The choice of reconstitution solvent depends on the specific peptide and its intended use. The three most common solvents used in clinical peptide therapy are bacteriostatic water, sterile water, and normal saline.

**Bacteriostatic Water (BAC Water)** is the preferred solvent for most clinical peptide reconstitutions. It contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which inhibits bacterial growth and allows the reconstituted peptide to be used over multiple doses across several weeks. Bacteriostatic water is the standard choice for peptides that will be stored and drawn from multiple times, which includes the vast majority of clinical applications.

**Sterile Water for Injection** contains no preservatives and is used when the entire vial will be administered in a single dose or when the patient has a known sensitivity to benzyl alcohol. Because it lacks antimicrobial properties, reconstituted solutions using sterile water must be used within 24 hours and cannot be stored for repeated use.

**Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl)** is occasionally recommended for specific peptides that require isotonic conditions for stability. Some peptides, particularly larger ones, may maintain better stability in saline solution. Always follow the manufacturer's specific reconstitution instructions when available.

## Step-by-Step Reconstitution Protocol

### Materials Needed

Before beginning the reconstitution process, gather all necessary materials in a clean workspace:

- Lyophilized peptide vial
- Bacteriostatic water (or specified solvent)
- Alcohol swabs (70% isopropyl alcohol)
- Insulin syringes (1 mL with 29-31 gauge needle)
- Clean, flat work surface

### The Reconstitution Process

**Step 1: Preparation.** Allow both the peptide vial and the bacteriostatic water to reach room temperature. Cold solvents can cause thermal shock to the peptide, potentially affecting its structure. Wash hands thoroughly and prepare a clean workspace.

**Step 2: Sterilize.** Wipe the rubber stoppers of both the peptide vial and the bacteriostatic water vial with alcohol swabs. Allow the alcohol to dry completely before proceeding, as residual alcohol can denature certain peptides.

**Step 3: Draw the Solvent.** Using a clean insulin syringe, draw the desired volume of bacteriostatic water. The volume you add determines the concentration of your solution. Common reconstitution volumes are 1 mL or 2 mL, depending on the peptide and desired concentration.

**Step 4: Add Solvent to Peptide.** Insert the needle through the rubber stopper of the peptide vial at a slight angle, aiming the needle toward the glass wall of the vial rather than directly at the peptide cake. Slowly depress the plunger, allowing the water to trickle down the side of the vial. This gentle approach prevents damage to the peptide structure.

**Step 5: Allow Dissolution.** Do not shake the vial. Instead, gently swirl or roll the vial between your palms to encourage dissolution. Most peptides will dissolve within 1-5 minutes. Some may require up to 15 minutes of gentle intermittent swirling. The solution should become clear and colorless. If it remains cloudy or contains visible particles after 15 minutes, do not use it.

**Step 6: Storage.** Once reconstituted, store the vial in the refrigerator at 2-8°C (36-46°F). Reconstituted peptides in bacteriostatic water typically remain stable for 21-28 days when properly refrigerated, though this varies by peptide.

## Dosage Calculation After Reconstitution

Understanding how to calculate dosages after reconstitution is essential for accurate peptide therapy. The concentration of the reconstituted solution depends on two factors: the amount of peptide in the vial and the volume of solvent added.

**The Formula:**

> Concentration (mcg/unit) = Total peptide (mcg) ÷ Total units of solvent

For example, if you have a 5 mg (5,000 mcg) vial of BPC-157 and add 2 mL of bacteriostatic water, the concentration is 2,500 mcg per mL, or 250 mcg per 0.1 mL (10 units on an insulin syringe).

| Peptide Amount | Solvent Volume | Concentration per 0.1 mL (10 units) |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| 5 mg (5,000 mcg) | 1 mL | 500 mcg |
| 5 mg (5,000 mcg) | 2 mL | 250 mcg |
| 10 mg (10,000 mcg) | 2 mL | 500 mcg |
| 10 mg (10,000 mcg) | 3 mL | 333 mcg |
| 2 mg (2,000 mcg) | 1 mL | 200 mcg |
| 2 mg (2,000 mcg) | 2 mL | 100 mcg |

## Common Reconstitution Mistakes to Avoid

**Shaking the vial** is the most common mistake. Vigorous shaking creates air bubbles and can cause the peptide chains to unfold (denature), destroying their biological activity. Always use gentle swirling motions.

**Spraying water directly onto the peptide cake** can cause localized high concentrations that lead to aggregation. Always aim the stream of water at the glass wall of the vial and let it trickle down to the peptide.

**Using tap water or non-sterile solvents** introduces contaminants that can cause infections and degrade the peptide. Only use pharmaceutical-grade bacteriostatic water or sterile water for injection.

**Storing at room temperature** after reconstitution dramatically accelerates degradation. Reconstituted peptides must be refrigerated immediately and kept at 2-8°C.

**Freezing reconstituted peptides** can cause ice crystal formation that damages the peptide structure. While lyophilized peptides can be stored frozen, reconstituted solutions should never be frozen.

**Reusing syringes** introduces contamination risk and can lead to inaccurate dosing due to dead space in the needle and hub. Always use a fresh syringe for each draw.

## Reconstitution Guidelines for Common Peptides

Different peptides may have specific reconstitution requirements. Here are guidelines for some of the most commonly used therapeutic peptides:

| Peptide | Typical Vial Size | Recommended Solvent Volume | Stability After Reconstitution |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| BPC-157 | 5 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 21-28 days refrigerated |
| TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) | 5 mg | 1-2 mL BAC water | 21 days refrigerated |
| Semaglutide | 3-5 mg | Per manufacturer instructions | 28 days refrigerated |
| CJC-1295 (no DAC) | 2-5 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 21 days refrigerated |
| Ipamorelin | 5 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 21-28 days refrigerated |
| GHK-Cu | 50-200 mg | 1-2 mL BAC water | 14-21 days refrigerated |
| PT-141 | 10 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 21 days refrigerated |
| Sermorelin | 3-9 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 14-21 days refrigerated |
| Thymosin Alpha-1 | 3 mg | 1 mL BAC water | 14 days refrigerated |
| AOD-9604 | 5 mg | 2 mL BAC water | 21 days refrigerated |

## Quality Assurance Considerations

Healthcare providers should implement quality assurance protocols for peptide reconstitution in their practice. This includes maintaining a reconstitution log that records the date, peptide lot number, solvent used, volume added, calculated concentration, and expiration date. This documentation supports both patient safety and regulatory compliance.

Providers should also verify the appearance of the lyophilized peptide before reconstitution. A properly lyophilized peptide should appear as a white to off-white powder or cake. Discoloration, excessive moisture, or unusual odors may indicate degradation during shipping or storage.
