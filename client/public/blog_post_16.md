## How It Works

### Step 1: Patient Assessment

The provider inputs key patient information:
- **Demographics:** Age, sex, weight, height, BMI
- **Health Goals:** Weight loss, muscle gain, cognitive enhancement, injury recovery, longevity, etc.
- **Medical History:** Chronic conditions, previous peptide use, allergies
- **Current Medications:** Prescription drugs, supplements, hormones
- **Lab Values:** Recent bloodwork, biomarkers, hormone levels

### Step 2: AI Analysis

PeptideProtocols.ai's machine learning algorithms analyze the input data against:
- **Clinical Evidence:** 2,800+ peer-reviewed studies
- **Safety Database:** Known contraindications and adverse events
- **Dosing Guidelines:** FDA-approved and clinical trial protocols
- **Combination Strategies:** Synergistic peptide stacking research

### Step 3: Protocol Generation

Within seconds, the system generates a comprehensive protocol including:
- **Primary Peptide Selection:** Optimal peptide(s) for stated goals
- **Dosing Schedule:** Specific doses, frequency, and timing
- **Titration Plan:** Gradual dose escalation for safety
- **Duration:** Recommended treatment length and cycling
- **Monitoring Plan:** Biomarkers to track, follow-up schedule
- **Safety Considerations:** Side effects to watch for, management strategies
- **Patient Instructions:** Administration technique, storage, reconstitution

### Step 4: Provider Review & Customization

The AI-generated protocol serves as a starting point. Providers can:
- Adjust doses based on clinical judgment
- Add or remove peptides from the stack
- Modify monitoring frequency
- Customize patient instructions
- Add practice-specific notes
