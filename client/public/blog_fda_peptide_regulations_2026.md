# FDA Peptide Regulations in 2026: What Healthcare Providers Must Know

*Published: February 8, 2026 | Peptide Education Hub | 16 min read*

The regulatory landscape for peptide therapy in the United States has undergone dramatic changes since the FDA's enforcement actions beginning in late 2024. For healthcare providers who prescribe, administer, or are considering adding peptide therapy to their practice, understanding the current regulatory framework is not just advisable — it is essential for legal compliance and patient safety. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of where FDA peptide regulations stand as of February 2026.

## The Regulatory Shift: What Changed

The FDA's approach to peptide regulation shifted significantly beginning in January 2025, when the agency began enforcing revisions to its interim policy on bulk drug substances used by compounding pharmacies. This enforcement action had immediate and far-reaching consequences for the peptide therapy industry.

The core issue centers on the FDA's authority over which bulk drug substances can be used in compounding. Under the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), compounding pharmacies can only use bulk drug substances that meet specific criteria. For many popular therapeutic peptides, the regulatory pathway has become uncertain.

## Current Status of Key Peptides

Understanding the regulatory status of individual peptides is critical for practice compliance. The following table summarizes the current status of commonly used therapeutic peptides as of February 2026:

| Peptide | FDA Status | Compounding Availability | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| Semaglutide | FDA-approved (Ozempic, Wegovy) | Available via 503A/503B when shortage exists | Subject to shortage status changes |
| Tirzepatide | FDA-approved (Mounjaro, Zepbound) | Available via 503A/503B when shortage exists | Subject to shortage status changes |
| BPC-157 | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review for bulk substances list | Regulatory status uncertain |
| Thymosin Alpha-1 | Not FDA-approved in US | Under FDA review | Available in other countries as Zadaxin |
| TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review for bulk substances list | Regulatory status uncertain |
| PT-141 (Bremelanotide) | FDA-approved (Vyleesi) | Available via 503B | Approved for HSDD in women |
| CJC-1295 | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review | Growth hormone releasing hormone analog |
| Ipamorelin | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review | Growth hormone secretagogue |
| Sermorelin | Previously FDA-approved | Available via compounding | Was marketed as Geref |
| GHK-Cu | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review | Copper peptide complex |
| AOD-9604 | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review | Anti-obesity drug fragment |
| Epithalon | Not FDA-approved | Under FDA review | Telomerase activator |

## The Bulk Drug Substances Review Process

The FDA maintains several lists that determine which substances can be used in compounding:

**Category 1 substances** have been evaluated and found to present significant safety risks. These substances cannot be used in compounding under either 503A or 503B pathways.

**Category 2 substances** are currently under evaluation. The FDA has not made a final determination, and their compounding status may change based on the review outcome.

**Category 3 substances** have been evaluated and found to be acceptable for use in compounding, subject to applicable conditions.

Many therapeutic peptides currently fall into Category 2, meaning they are under active review. Providers using these peptides should monitor the FDA's Bulk Drug Substances Advisory Committee meetings and published guidance documents for updates.

## Practical Compliance Framework for Providers

Healthcare providers can take several concrete steps to ensure their peptide therapy practice remains compliant with current regulations:

### 1. Source from Registered Facilities

The most important compliance step is ensuring that all peptides are sourced from either FDA-registered 503B outsourcing facilities or properly licensed 503A compounding pharmacies. Providers should never source peptides from research chemical suppliers, overseas pharmacies, or unregistered domestic sources for patient use.

### 2. Maintain Proper Documentation

Every peptide administration should be supported by comprehensive documentation including:

- Patient assessment and medical necessity documentation
- Informed consent specific to peptide therapy
- Source documentation (Certificate of Analysis, pharmacy license)
- Administration records (lot number, dose, route, site)
- Adverse event monitoring and reporting

### 3. Stay Current with FDA Guidance

The FDA publishes guidance documents, warning letters, and advisory committee meeting minutes that directly affect peptide therapy practice. Key resources include:

- FDA's Compounding page (fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding)
- FDA's Drug Shortage Database
- Federal Register notices on bulk drug substances
- State pharmacy board bulletins

### 4. Implement a Compliance Review Process

Practices should conduct quarterly reviews of their peptide therapy protocols to ensure alignment with current regulations. This review should include verification of supplier credentials, assessment of any new FDA guidance, and updates to informed consent documents.

## The Role of State Regulations

While FDA regulations provide the federal framework, state regulations add an additional layer of requirements that providers must navigate. State pharmacy boards, medical boards, and health departments may impose additional restrictions on peptide therapy that go beyond federal requirements.

Some states have taken proactive positions on peptide therapy regulation, while others have been more permissive. Providers should consult with legal counsel familiar with their state's specific regulatory environment to ensure full compliance.

## Impact of the Current Administration

The current political environment has introduced additional uncertainty into peptide regulation. Discussions about reforming the FDA's approach to compounding, potential changes to the DQSA framework, and broader healthcare policy shifts all have implications for peptide therapy providers.

While some industry observers anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment for peptide therapy, providers should not make compliance decisions based on anticipated regulatory changes. Until new regulations are formally adopted, existing rules remain in effect and enforceable.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

Given the regulatory uncertainty, providers should implement risk mitigation strategies that protect both their practice and their patients:

**Diversify your peptide sources** across multiple compliant suppliers to reduce supply chain risk if one source becomes unavailable due to regulatory action.

**Maintain detailed records** of all sourcing decisions, including the regulatory basis for using each peptide. This documentation can be invaluable if your practice is ever subject to regulatory inquiry.

**Invest in patient education** about the regulatory status of their treatments. Informed patients who understand the regulatory landscape are better partners in their own care and less likely to seek peptides from unregulated sources.

**Engage with professional organizations** that advocate for rational peptide regulation, such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M), the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, and state medical associations.

## Looking Ahead: What to Watch in 2026

Several regulatory developments are expected to unfold during 2026 that could significantly impact peptide therapy:

- FDA's continued review of bulk drug substances for the 503B list
- Potential congressional action on compounding pharmacy reform
- State-level legislative initiatives affecting peptide therapy
- FDA enforcement actions and warning letters
- Drug shortage status changes for GLP-1 receptor agonists
