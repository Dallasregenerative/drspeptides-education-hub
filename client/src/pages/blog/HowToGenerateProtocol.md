## Step 2: Input Patient Information

You'll be guided through a simple, intuitive interface to input your patient's information. This includes:

-   **Patient Goals:** What are they trying to achieve? (e.g., weight loss, injury recovery, improved cognition)
-   **Health History:** Any existing medical conditions or relevant history.
-   **Current Medications:** To screen for potential interactions.
-   **Lab Results:** Upload relevant lab work for more precise recommendations.
-   **Lifestyle Factors:** Diet, exercise, sleep, and stress levels.

## Step 3: Let the AI Work Its Magic

Once you've entered the patient data, simply click "Generate Protocol." In the background, 16 specialized AI agents will:

1.  Analyze the 50+ patient factors you provided.
2.  Cross-reference this data with over 2,800 clinical studies.
3.  Collaborate to determine the optimal combination of peptides.
4.  Screen for any potential contraindications.
5.  Calculate the precise, evidence-based dosing.

This entire process takes about 30-60 seconds.

## Step 4: Review and Customize Your Protocol

You'll be presented with a comprehensive protocol that includes:

-   **Recommended Peptides:** The specific peptides chosen by the AI.
-   **Dosing and Administration:** Precise dosing, frequency, and route of administration.
-   **Clinical Rationale:** The evidence-based reasoning behind each recommendation.
-   **Monitoring Parameters:** Key biomarkers to track for efficacy and safety.
-   **Patient Education:** A summary you can share with your patient.

You have full control to review, customize, and approve the protocol before finalizing it.

## Step 5: Download and Implement

With one click, you can download the complete protocol as a professional PDF, ready to be added to your patient's chart or shared with them directly.

That's it! In less than 5 minutes, you've created a highly personalized, evidence-based peptide protocol that would have taken hours to research manually.
