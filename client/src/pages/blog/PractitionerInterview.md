We sat down with Dr. Emily Carter, a functional medicine physician who recently integrated Dr. Peptide AI into her practice. Here’s what she had to say about her experience.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Carter, you’ve been using peptide therapy in your practice for over 5 years. What made you decide to try Dr. Peptide AI?

**Dr. Carter:** Honestly, I was skeptical at first. I’ve always prided myself on creating my own protocols. But I was spending hours every week researching and cross-referencing information for each new patient. It was becoming unsustainable. I was looking for a way to be more efficient without sacrificing the quality of care.

**Interviewer:** What was your experience like using Dr. Peptide AI for the first time?

**Dr. Carter:** It was incredibly intuitive. I took a complex patient—a 55-year-old male with metabolic syndrome, low testosterone, and cognitive complaints. It would have taken me at least an hour to create a protocol for him. With Dr. Peptide AI, I had a comprehensive, evidence-based protocol in under 5 minutes. It even flagged a potential interaction with a medication he was taking that I might have missed.

**Interviewer:** What were the results?

**Dr. Carter:** The AI recommended a protocol that was similar to what I would have designed, but with a few key differences in dosing and peptide selection that I hadn’t considered. The patient’s results were phenomenal. His labs improved faster than I expected, and he reported a significant improvement in energy and mental clarity within the first month. The AI’s ability to synthesize data from thousands of studies gave me an edge I didn’t have on my own.

**Interviewer:** How has Dr. Peptide AI changed your practice?

**Dr. Carter:** It’s been a game-changer. I’m saving at least 10 hours a week on protocol design. My patients are getting better results. And I have more confidence in my recommendations because I know they’re backed by a massive amount of data. It’s not about replacing my clinical judgment; it’s about augmenting it. It’s like having a team of 16 research assistants working for me 24/7.

**Interviewer:** What would you say to other practitioners who are on the fence about using AI?

**Dr. Carter:** Just try it. The time you’ll save and the results you’ll see will speak for themselves. This is the future of medicine, and it’s here now. Don’t get left behind.
