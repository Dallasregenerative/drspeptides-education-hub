# Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide: GLP-1 Agonist Comparison

## Overview

Both semaglutide and tirzepatide are FDA-approved medications for weight loss and diabetes management, but tirzepatide's dual-agonist mechanism offers distinct advantages.

## Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy)

**Mechanism:** GLP-1 receptor agonist

**FDA Approval:**
- Ozempic (diabetes): 2017
- Wegovy (weight loss): 2021

**Average Weight Loss:** 15-17% of body weight

**Dosing:** Weekly subcutaneous injection (0.25mg to 2.4mg)

**Primary Benefits:**
- Significant weight loss
- Improved glycemic control
- Cardiovascular benefits
- Reduced appetite
- Slower gastric emptying

## Tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound)

**Mechanism:** Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist

**FDA Approval:**
- Mounjaro (diabetes): 2022
- Zepbound (weight loss): 2023

**Average Weight Loss:** 20-22% of body weight

**Dosing:** Weekly subcutaneous injection (2.5mg to 15mg)

**Primary Benefits:**
- Superior weight loss vs semaglutide
- Enhanced metabolic effects
- Better glucose control
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Potential muscle preservation

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Semaglutide | Tirzepatide |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Weight Loss** | 15-17% | 20-22% |
| **Mechanism** | GLP-1 only | GLP-1 + GIP |
| **Nausea Rate** | 20-30% | 15-25% |
| **Cost** | $$$ | $$$$ |
| **Track Record** | Longer (2017) | Newer (2022) |
| **Muscle Preservation** | Moderate | Better |
| **A1C Reduction** | 1.5-2.0% | 2.0-2.5% |

## Clinical Trial Results

**STEP Trials (Semaglutide):**
- Average 15.3% weight loss at 68 weeks
- 86% achieved ≥5% weight loss
- Significant cardiovascular benefits

**SURMOUNT Trials (Tirzepatide):**
- Average 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks
- 91% achieved ≥5% weight loss
- Superior metabolic improvements

## Side Effect Profile

**Both Medications:**
- Nausea (most common, usually transient)
- Diarrhea
- Constipation
- Abdominal pain
- Fatigue

**Tirzepatide Advantages:**
- Slightly lower nausea rates
- Better GI tolerability in some patients

**Contraindications (Both):**
- Personal/family history of medullary thyroid cancer
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

## Cost Considerations

**Semaglutide:**
- Ozempic: ~$900-1,000/month
- Wegovy: ~$1,300-1,400/month
- Compounded: $200-400/month

**Tirzepatide:**
- Mounjaro/Zepbound: ~$1,000-1,100/month
- Compounded: $300-500/month

## Which One to Choose?

**Choose Semaglutide If:**
- Longer track record preferred
- Lower cost is priority
- Good results at lower doses
- Insurance covers it

**Choose Tirzepatide If:**
- Maximum weight loss desired
- Better metabolic control needed
- Muscle preservation important
- Can tolerate higher cost

## Combination with Other Peptides

Both can be stacked with:
- BPC-157 (gut protection, muscle preservation)
- CJC-1295/Ipamorelin (muscle maintenance)
- NAD+ (metabolic support)

## Conclusion

**Semaglutide** offers proven, significant weight loss with a longer safety track record.

**Tirzepatide** provides superior weight loss and metabolic benefits through its dual-agonist mechanism.

Both are excellent options—choice depends on individual goals, tolerance, and budget.
