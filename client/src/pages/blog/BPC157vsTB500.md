# BPC-157 vs TB-500: Complete Comparison Guide

## Overview

Both BPC-157 and TB-500 are powerful regenerative peptides used for tissue repair and recovery, but they have distinct mechanisms and applications.

## BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound)

**Mechanism:** Promotes angiogenesis, enhances growth factor production, modulates nitric oxide

**Primary Benefits:**
- Accelerated wound healing
- Tendon and ligament repair
- Gut healing and protection
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Neuroprotective properties

**Typical Dosing:** 250-500 mcg daily, subcutaneous or intramuscular

**Best For:**
- Acute injuries
- Gut issues (IBS, leaky gut)
- Tendon/ligament injuries
- Post-surgical recovery

## TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4 Fragment)

**Mechanism:** Promotes cell migration, reduces inflammation, enhances tissue remodeling

**Primary Benefits:**
- Muscle recovery and growth
- Flexibility and range of motion
- Systemic healing
- Hair growth
- Reduced inflammation

**Typical Dosing:** 2-5 mg twice weekly for loading, then maintenance

**Best For:**
- Chronic injuries
- Muscle strains
- Systemic inflammation
- Athletic performance
- Hair restoration

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | BPC-157 | TB-500 |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Speed of Action** | Faster (days) | Slower (weeks) |
| **Localized vs Systemic** | More localized | More systemic |
| **Gut Healing** | Excellent | Minimal |
| **Muscle Recovery** | Good | Excellent |
| **Flexibility** | Moderate | Excellent |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Dosing Frequency** | Daily | 2x/week |

## Stacking BPC-157 + TB-500

Many practitioners combine both peptides for synergistic effects:

**Benefits of Stacking:**
- Comprehensive tissue repair
- Faster recovery
- Both localized and systemic healing
- Enhanced results for complex injuries

**Typical Stack Protocol:**
- BPC-157: 250-500 mcg daily
- TB-500: 2-5 mg twice weekly

## Clinical Applications

**Use BPC-157 Alone For:**
- Acute tendon/ligament injuries
- Gut healing protocols
- Post-surgical recovery
- Localized injuries

**Use TB-500 Alone For:**
- Chronic muscle injuries
- Systemic inflammation
- Athletic performance
- Hair restoration

**Use Both Together For:**
- Complex injuries
- Maximum recovery
- Chronic conditions
- Competitive athletes

## Safety Profile

Both peptides have excellent safety profiles with minimal side effects.

**Common Side Effects (Both):**
- Mild injection site reactions
- Temporary fatigue
- Headache (rare)

**Contraindications:**
- Active cancer (theoretical concern)
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

## Conclusion

**BPC-157** excels at localized healing, gut repair, and acute injuries with faster onset.

**TB-500** provides systemic healing, muscle recovery, and flexibility with sustained effects.

**Together**, they offer comprehensive regenerative support for complex healing needs.
