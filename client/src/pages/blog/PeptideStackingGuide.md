# Peptide Stacking Guide: Synergistic Protocols

## What is Peptide Stacking?

Peptide stacking involves combining multiple peptides to achieve synergistic effects that exceed what any single peptide can provide.

## Key Principles of Stacking

### 1. Complementary Mechanisms
Combine peptides with different mechanisms of action for comprehensive benefits.

### 2. Timing Optimization
Some peptides work better at specific times:
- **Morning:** GH secretagogues, cognitive peptides
- **Pre-workout:** Performance peptides
- **Evening:** Recovery peptides, sleep optimization
- **Anytime:** Regenerative peptides

### 3. Dosing Considerations
Start with lower doses when stacking to assess tolerance.

### 4. Cycling Protocols
Some stacks benefit from cycling (on/off periods) to maintain effectiveness.

## Top Peptide Stacks by Goal

### 1. Maximum Fat Loss Stack

**Primary:**

- TB-500 (muscle recovery, flexibility)
- IGF-1 LR3 (muscle growth)

**Protocol:**
- CJC-1295: 2mg weekly
- Ipamorelin: 200-300mcg daily
- BPC-157: 250-500mcg daily
- TB-500: 2-5mg 2x/week

**Expected Results:** Enhanced muscle growth, faster recovery, injury prevention

### 3. Anti-Aging & Longevity Stack

**Foundation:**
- Epitalon (telomere lengthening)
- GHK-Cu (tissue remodeling)
- Thymosin Alpha-1 (immune function)

**Advanced:**
- SS-31 (mitochondrial health)
- Humanin (neuroprotection)
- NAD+ (cellular energy)

**Protocol:**
- Epitalon: 10mg/day for 20 days, 2-4x/year
- GHK-Cu: 2mg 3x/week
- Thymosin Alpha-1: 1.6mg 2x/week
- SS-31: 2-5mg daily
- Humanin: 2-5mg 3x/week
- NAD+: Per formulation

**Expected Results:** Cellular rejuvenation, enhanced vitality, longevity optimization

### 4. Cognitive Enhancement Stack

**Primary:**
- Semax (BDNF, focus, memory)
- Selank (anxiety reduction, clarity)

**Synergistic:**
- Dihexa (neurogenesis)
- Humanin (neuroprotection)
- NAD+ (brain energy)

**Protocol:**
- Semax: 300-600mcg daily (nasal, morning)
- Selank: 300-600mcg daily (nasal, as needed)
- Dihexa: 5mg 2-3x/week
- Humanin: 2-5mg 3x/week
- NAD+: Daily

**Expected Results:** Enhanced focus, memory, cognitive performance

### 5. Athletic Performance Stack

**Pre-Workout:**
- TB-500 (flexibility, endurance)
- BPC-157 (injury prevention)

**Post-Workout:**
- CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin (recovery, GH)
- IGF-1 LR3 (muscle growth)

**Daily:**
- MOTS-c (mitochondrial function, endurance)

**Protocol:**
- TB-500: 2-5mg 2x/week
- BPC-157: 250-500mcg daily
- CJC/Ipa: Daily post-workout
- IGF-1 LR3: 40-80mcg post-workout
- MOTS-c: 5-10mg 2x/week

**Expected Results:** Enhanced performance, faster recovery, injury resilience

### 6. Injury Recovery Stack

**Acute Phase (0-4 weeks):**
- BPC-157: 500mcg 2x/day (localized)
- TB-500: 5mg 2x/week (systemic)

**Recovery Phase (4-12 weeks):**
- BPC-157: 250-500mcg daily
- TB-500: 2-5mg 2x/week
- GHK-Cu: 2mg 3x/week

**Maintenance:**
- BPC-157: 250mcg daily
- TB-500: 2mg weekly

**Expected Results:** Accelerated healing, reduced inflammation, tissue remodeling

## Safety Considerations When Stacking

### Monitor Carefully
- Start with one peptide at a time
- Add additional peptides gradually
- Track response and side effects

### Potential Interactions
Most peptides have minimal interactions, but monitor for:
- Cumulative side effects
- Synergistic effects (good and bad)
- Individual tolerance

### Quality Sourcing
When stacking multiple peptides, quality becomes even more critical:
- Use cGMP-certified sources
- Verify third-party testing
- Check certificates of analysis

## Cost Optimization

**Budget Stack (Effective):**
- BPC-157 + TB-500 (recovery)
- CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin (GH)
- Cost: $200-400/month

**Mid-Range Stack:**
- Add Semaglutide or cognitive peptides
- Cost: $400-700/month

**Premium Stack:**
- Full longevity protocol with multiple peptides
- Cost: $800-1,500/month

## Cycling Protocols

**Continuous:**
- Regenerative peptides (BPC-157, TB-500)
- Weight loss peptides (Semaglutide, Tirzepatide)

**Cycled (4-8 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off):**
- GH secretagogues (CJC/Ipa)
- Cognitive peptides (Semax, Selank)

**Periodic (2-4 cycles/year):**
