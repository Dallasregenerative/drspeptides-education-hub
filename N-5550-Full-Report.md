## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

### 2.1 Dihexa – Neurogenic Pathways

Dihexa is a highly potent, orally active, and blood-brain barrier-penetrating peptide that is an analog of Angiotensin IV. It acts as a specific agonist of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-Met. The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway is crucial for neuronal development, survival, and regeneration. Dihexa has been shown to be seven orders of magnitude more potent than brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in promoting synaptogenesis, the formation of new synapses between neurons. This leads to lasting structural changes in the brain, enhancing neural connectivity and plasticity. By promoting the growth of new dendrites and synapses, Dihexa can improve learning, memory consolidation, and recall. It has also been shown to enhance hippocampal function and spatial memory.

### 2.2 Tesofensine – Neurotransmitter Optimization

Tesofensine is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, three key neurotransmitters involved in cognitive function, mood, and motivation. By increasing the synaptic availability of these neurotransmitters, Tesofensine optimizes the balance required for sharp focus, sustained attention, and mental drive. Its high-affinity inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT) contributes to its profound effects on cognitive and metabolic health. In addition to its cognitive-enhancing properties, Tesofensine is a potent appetite suppressant and has been shown in clinical trials to produce significant weight loss and improvements in metabolic parameters.

### 2.3 Methylene Blue – Mitochondrial Enhancement

Methylene Blue is a well-established compound with a long history of medical use. At low doses, it acts as a powerful metabolic enhancer and antioxidant. Within the mitochondria, Methylene Blue functions as an alternative electron carrier in the electron transport chain, bypassing complexes I and III. This process increases the efficiency of ATP production, the primary energy currency of the cell, and reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause oxidative stress and cellular damage. By enhancing mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism, Methylene Blue provides neuroprotective effects and optimizes cognitive function. It has been shown to improve memory and attention in both healthy individuals and those with cognitive impairments.
