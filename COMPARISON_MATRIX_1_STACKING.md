## Stacking Safety Guidelines

### General Principles

**Start Low, Go Slow:**
- Introduce one peptide at a time (2-week intervals minimum)
- Assess individual tolerance before adding next peptide
- Titrate each peptide to effective dose before stacking

**Monitoring Intensity:**
- 2-peptide stacks: Baseline + 4-week + 12-week labs
- 3+ peptide stacks: Baseline + 4-week + 8-week + 12-week labs
- Any adverse events: Immediate reassessment

**Drug Interactions:**
- GLP-1 agonists: Monitor with insulin, sulfonylureas (hypoglycemia risk)
- Growth hormone secretagogues: Caution with diabetes medications
- Immune modulators: Avoid with immunosuppressants without specialist consultation

### Contraindicated Combinations

**Avoid These Stacks:**
- Multiple GLP-1 agonists simultaneously (Semaglutide + Tirzepatide)
- Excessive GH secretagogues (>3 different GHRPs/GHRHs)
- Immune stimulators in autoimmune disease (TA1 + LL-37 in active autoimmunity)

### Patient Stratification

**Conservative Stacking (2 peptides max):**
- First-time peptide users
- Age >65 years
- Multiple comorbidities
- Polypharmacy (>5 medications)

**Moderate Stacking (3 peptides):**
- Experienced peptide users
- Good baseline health
- Clear therapeutic goals
- Regular monitoring compliance

**Advanced Stacking (4+ peptides):**
- Functional medicine practitioners with expertise
- Patients with comprehensive monitoring
- Clear risk-benefit assessment
- Regular practitioner oversight

## Timing Optimization

### Circadian Considerations

**Morning Administration:**
- Semax (cognitive enhancement)
- AOD-9604 (lipolysis)
- GHRP-2 (if using 2x/day)

**Pre-Workout:**
- MGF (muscle growth)
- BPC-157 (if targeting exercise-related injury)

**Evening/Bedtime:**
- CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin (GH pulse)
- Sermorelin (GH pulse)
- Selank (if using for sleep/anxiety)

**Meal Timing:**
- GLP-1 agonists: Any time, consistent weekly schedule
- Growth hormone secretagogues: Fasted state (2+ hours post-meal)
- BPC-157/TB-500: Meal timing not critical

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

| Stack Tier | Monthly Cost Range | Clinical Value | Best For |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Basic (1-2 peptides)** | $150-400 | High ROI for targeted conditions | Most patients, first-time users |
| **Moderate (3 peptides)** | $400-800 | Good ROI for complex conditions | Experienced users, multi-system goals |
| **Advanced (4+ peptides)** | $800-1500+ | Variable ROI, requires expertise | Comprehensive optimization, practitioner-guided |

## Clinical Decision Tree

**Step 1: Define Primary Goal**
- Recovery/Injury → Recovery Stacks
- Body Composition → GH or Weight Loss Stacks
- Cognitive → Nootropic Stacks
- Longevity → Anti-Aging Stacks
- Immune → Immune Modulation Stacks

**Step 2: Assess Patient Factors**
- Age, comorbidities, medications
- Previous peptide experience
- Monitoring compliance capability
- Budget considerations

**Step 3: Select Stack Tier**
- Conservative: 1-2 peptides
- Moderate: 2-3 peptides
- Advanced: 3-4 peptides (practitioner-guided only)

**Step 4: Implement & Monitor**
- Baseline labs and assessments
- Introduce peptides sequentially
- Regular monitoring per protocol
- Adjust based on response and tolerance

## References & Evidence Levels

**Evidence Level Definitions:**
- **FDA-approved RCTs:** Highest quality evidence from controlled trials
- **Clinical trials:** Published human studies (may be open-label or small)
- **Animal + observational:** Mechanism supported by animal data + human case series
- **Mechanism-based:** Theoretical rationale with preliminary human data
- **Case reports:** Individual patient experiences, lowest evidence level

**Key Citations:**
- Semaglutide STEP trials (NEJM 2021)
- Tirzepatide SURMOUNT trials (NEJM 2022)
- Retatrutide Phase 2 (NEJM 2023)
- BPC-157 mechanisms (multiple animal studies)
- Growth hormone secretagogue trials (various)
