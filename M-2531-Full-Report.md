## 1. Composition & Overview

**Formula Classification:** Dual-pathway mitochondrial and metabolic modulator – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**
- MOTS-c – 10 mg
- NAD+ – 50 mg

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for daily use, designed to ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.

**Therapeutic Intent:**
- To enhance mitochondrial function, improve metabolic health, and support cellular energy production by combining a key mitochondrial signaling peptide (MOTS-c) with an essential metabolic coenzyme (NAD+). This formula is designed to combat age-related metabolic decline, improve insulin sensitivity, and enhance physical performance.

## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

Formula M-2531 integrates two fundamental components of cellular energy metabolism to create a powerful synergistic effect.

### 2.1 MOTS-c: Mitochondrial-Derived Exercise Mimetic

MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-derived peptide that acts as a systemic metabolic regulator. It activates the AMPK pathway, a master switch for cellular energy homeostasis, which promotes fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake, mimicking the effects of exercise [1, 2, 3]. It also reduces the expression of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, helping to preserve lean muscle mass [4].

### 2.2 NAD+: Fundamental Cellular Energy

NAD+ is a critical coenzyme essential for mitochondrial ATP production and is the sole substrate for sirtuins, a family of proteins that regulate cellular health and longevity [5]. By providing a direct precursor, this formula ensures that cells have the necessary resources to fuel the metabolic enhancements signaled by MOTS-c.

## 3. Synergistic Integration Table

| Level | Primary Pathway | Key Components | Integrated Clinical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signaling | AMPK Activation | MOTS-c | Initiates a cellular program mimicking exercise, promoting fat burning and glucose uptake. |
| Fuel | NAD+ Biosynthesis & Redox Balance | NAD+ | Provides the essential coenzyme required to execute the metabolic program initiated by MOTS-c, and activates sirtuin longevity pathways. |
| Systemic | Metabolic & Muscular Health | Both | A powerful combination that both signals for and fuels enhanced metabolic function, leading to improved insulin sensitivity, body composition, and physical performance. |
