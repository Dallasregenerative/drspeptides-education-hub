## Mechanism of Action

### Four-Pathway Neuro-Cognitive Enhancement:

- **Dihexa (Neuroplastic Structural Enhancement):**
  - Potentiates hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activity at c-Met receptors.
  - Seven orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF for neurotrophic activity.
  - Promotes synaptogenesis and hippocampal spinogenesis.
  - Enhances spatial memory formation and cognitive function.

- **Selank (Anxiolytic & GABAergic Modulation):**
  - Enhances GABAergic neurotransmission through GABA-A receptor optimization.
  - Anxiolytic effect comparable to benzodiazepines without sedation or dependence.
  - Increases BDNF expression supporting neuroplasticity.
  - Modulates serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems.

- **Semax (BDNF Upregulation & Neuroprotection):**
  - Rapidly increases BDNF levels 1.4-fold and TrkB receptor phosphorylation 1.6-fold.
  - Enhances neurotransmitter systems including dopamine and serotonin.
  - Exhibits potent antioxidant properties and reduces neuroinflammation.
  - Improves cerebral blood flow and protects against ischemic damage.

- **NAD+ (Metabolic Foundation & Cellular Energy):**
  - Critical cofactor in mitochondrial ATP production.
  - Activates sirtuins (SIRT1-7) that regulate DNA repair and metabolism.
  - Activates PARPs for DNA damage detection and repair.
  - Declines approximately 50% by mid-age, contributing to aging processes.

## Safety Profile & Contraindications

### Professional Medical Oversight Strongly Recommended

### Absolute Contraindications
- Pregnancy and lactation (insufficient safety data).
- Active cancer or recent cancer history (Dihexa's HGF/c-Met pathway involvement).
- Severe cardiovascular disease, liver, or kidney dysfunction.
- Known hypersensitivity to any component.

### Requires Medical Supervision & Monitoring
- **Cardiovascular:** Semax lowers blood pressure; monitor regularly.
- **Diabetes:** NAD+ may alter insulin sensitivity; monitor blood glucose.
- **Bleeding Disorders:** Selank exerts blood-thinning effects.
- **Psychiatric Medications:** Selank may enhance benzodiazepine effects.

### Key Drug Interactions
- **Diabetes medications:** Monitor blood glucose; may enhance insulin effects.
- **Blood pressure medications:** May enhance hypotensive effects.
- **Benzodiazepines:** Selank may enhance effects; consider dose reduction.
- **Anticoagulants:** Monitor coagulation due to Selank's blood-thinning effects.

## Scientific Evidence

**Evidence Level: MODERATE to HIGH** – Extensive research on individual peptide components with well-understood mechanisms of action. Clinical trials demonstrating efficacy for Selank and Semax. Robust NAD+ research. Limited human data for Dihexa with strong preclinical evidence.

**Key Research:**
- **Dihexa:** Seven orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF; restored cognitive performance in Alzheimer's mouse models.
- **Selank:** 62 patients with GAD: equivalent efficacy to medazepam with superior safety profile.
- **Semax:** 50-250 µg/kg resulted in rapid BDNF increase within 3 hours; enhanced stroke recovery.
- **NAD+:** 250mg NMN daily for 12 weeks significantly increased blood NAD+ levels; improved cardiovascular function.

## Clinical Applications

### Primary Indications
- Cognitive decline and memory impairment.
- Anxiety and stress disorders.
- ADHD and attention deficit.
- Depression and mood disorders.
- Stroke recovery.
- Neurodegenerative disease prevention.

### Ideal Candidates
- Adults seeking cognitive enhancement.

## Monitoring Recommendations

- **Pre-Treatment:** Complete health history, cognitive baseline, cardiovascular evaluation, blood glucose, liver/kidney function.
- **First 2 Weeks:** Daily self-monitoring of cognitive performance and mood; blood pressure if indicated.
- **Monthly (First 3 Months):** Clinical assessment, cognitive function tracking, blood pressure and glucose checks.
- **Long-Term:** Comprehensive evaluation every 3 months; annual metabolic panel.
