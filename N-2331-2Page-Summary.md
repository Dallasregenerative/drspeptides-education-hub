## Mechanism of Action

### Comprehensive Neuro-Cognitive & Metabolic Enhancement:

**Dihexa (Neuroplastic Structural Enhancement):**
- A potent HGF/c-Met activator, Dihexa is seven orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF in promoting synaptogenesis. It enhances neural connectivity, learning, and memory by building new neural infrastructure.

**Selank (Anxiolytic & GABAergic Modulation):**
- A synthetic analog of tuftsin, Selank modulates the GABAergic system for anxiety reduction without sedation. It also influences BDNF expression, contributing to its nootropic and neuroprotective effects.

**Semax (BDNF Upregulation & Neuroprotection):**
- A synthetic peptide analog of ACTH, Semax is a powerful nootropic that increases BDNF and TrkB receptor expression. It enhances attention, memory, and cognitive performance, especially under stress, and has potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties.

**NAD+ (Metabolic Foundation & Cellular Energy):**
- A critical coenzyme for cellular energy production (ATP), NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function. It also activates sirtuins and PARPs, enzymes involved in DNA repair and longevity. NAD+ levels decline with age, and supplementation supports cellular energy and overall health.

**Synergistic Integration:** This formula combines peptides that build neural infrastructure (Dihexa), optimize neurotransmitter function (Selank, Semax), and support cellular energy (NAD+), creating a comprehensive approach to cognitive enhancement and metabolic optimization.
