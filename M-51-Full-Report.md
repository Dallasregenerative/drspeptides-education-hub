## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

### 2.1 5-Amino-1MQ – NNMT Inhibitor and NAD+ Preservation

5-Amino-1MQ is a potent, selective, and cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT is an enzyme primarily active in adipose tissue and the liver that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular energy and metabolism. By methylating nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3), NNMT consumes methyl groups and contributes to the depletion of the essential coenzyme NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide). Elevated NNMT expression is strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.

By inhibiting NNMT, 5-Amino-1MQ prevents the excessive methylation of nicotinamide, leading to a series of beneficial downstream effects. Firstly, it preserves and increases intracellular NAD+ levels. NAD+ is a critical coenzyme for hundreds of enzymatic reactions, including those catalyzed by sirtuins (SIRT1), a class of proteins that regulate cellular health, mitochondrial function, and longevity. Increased NAD+ availability enhances SIRT1 activity, which in turn promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria) and improves oxidative metabolism through the PGC-1α pathway. Secondly, by reducing NNMT activity, 5-Amino-1MQ shifts the metabolic profile of adipocytes (fat cells) from a state of fat storage to one of fat mobilization and oxidation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 5-Amino-1MQ can reverse diet-induced obesity, reduce white adipose tissue mass, and decrease circulating cholesterol levels, all without affecting food intake or lean muscle mass.

### 2.2 SLU-PP-332 – ERR Agonist and Exercise Gene Program Activation

SLU-PP-332 is a synthetic agonist of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), a group of nuclear receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ) that are highly expressed in tissues with high energy demand, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. ERRs are key regulators of cellular energy metabolism and are naturally activated by exercise. They function as transcription factors that control the expression of a wide array of genes involved in mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation.

By activating ERRs, SLU-PP-332 effectively mimics the genetic and metabolic response to endurance exercise. It stimulates a transcriptional program in skeletal muscle that leads to increased mitochondrial content, enhanced oxidative capacity, and a shift in muscle fiber type towards more fatigue-resistant, oxidative type I fibers. This results in a significant increase in the body's ability to burn fat for energy. Animal studies have shown that SLU-PP-332 can increase energy expenditure, improve insulin sensitivity, and enhance endurance, allowing for longer and more intense physical activity. This makes it a powerful tool for improving metabolic health and physical performance, even in the absence of actual exercise.
