**PHYSICIAN USE ONLY | RESEARCH PEPTIDES**

*Last Updated: February 5, 2026*

---

## 1. Composition & Therapeutic Overview

**Formula Classification:** Dual-pathway metabolic modulator & exercise mimetic – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**

| Component | Dosage | Primary Mechanism of Action |
|---|---|---|
| **5-Amino-1MQ** | 50 mg | Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (NNMT) Inhibitor |
| **SLU-PP-332** | 1 mg | Pan-Agonist of Estrogen-Related Receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ) |

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for daily use, designed to ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability of both components.

**Therapeutic Rationale & Intent:**
- Formula M-51 is engineered to replicate the metabolic and body composition benefits of physical exercise by simultaneously **inhibiting fat storage (5-Amino-1MQ)** and **increasing fat oxidation in muscle (SLU-PP-332)**.
- This formula creates a powerful "push-pull" effect on body fat, making it a highly effective agent for individuals seeking to improve body composition, enhance metabolic rate, and achieve the physiological benefits of exercise, particularly those who may be unable to engage in intense physical activity.

## 2. Deep Mechanism of Action

Formula M-51 integrates two powerful, synergistic metabolic modulators to reprogram cellular energy handling at the level of both fat and muscle tissue.

### 2.1 5-Amino-1MQ: NNMT Inhibition & Adipose Reprogramming

5-Amino-1MQ is a potent, membrane-permeable, small molecule inhibitor of Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT is an enzyme highly expressed in adipose (fat) tissue that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy and metabolism. By inhibiting NNMT, 5-Amino-1MQ triggers a cascade of beneficial effects:
- **Increased NAD+ Levels:** NNMT consumes NAD+ in its reaction. Inhibiting it preserves and increases intracellular NAD+ levels, a critical coenzyme for mitochondrial function and sirtuin activity.
- **Reduced Fat Storage:** NNMT inhibition alters the metabolic programming of adipocytes, reducing their capacity to store fat and promoting the release of fatty acids.
- **Adipose Tissue "Browning":** It can induce a phenotype shift in white adipose tissue (WAT) towards a more metabolically active, thermogenic state similar to brown adipose tissue (BAT) [1].

### 2.2 SLU-PP-332: Pharmacological Exercise Mimicry in Muscle

SLU-PP-332 is a potent, orally bioavailable pan-agonist of the Estrogen-Related Receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ). These nuclear receptors are master regulators of cellular energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demand like skeletal muscle. By activating these receptors, SLU-PP-332 induces a gene expression profile that closely mimics the effects of endurance exercise. This includes:
- **Increased Fatty Acid Oxidation:** Upregulation of genes involved in the transport and beta-oxidation of fatty acids, effectively reprogramming muscle to prefer fat as its primary fuel source.
- **Mitochondrial Biogenesis:** Increased expression of PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial creation, leading to more and healthier mitochondria.
- **Increased Resting Energy Expenditure:** Effectively "revving up" the metabolic engine of muscle to burn more calories, even at rest [2].

## 3. Synergistic Architecture: A Multi-Level Analysis

The profound efficacy of M-51 lies in its elegant "push-pull" synergy, creating a powerful and unidirectional flow of energy out of fat stores and into muscle for oxidation.

| Level | Primary Pathway | Key Components & Interactions | Integrated Clinical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adipose Tissue (The "Push")** | NNMT Inhibition & NAD+ Salvage | **5-Amino-1MQ** inhibits NNMT in fat cells. This blocks their ability to store fat and promotes the release of stored fatty acids into the bloodstream. It also increases cellular NAD+, enhancing metabolic rate. | A powerful mobilization of stored energy. Fat is actively "pushed" out of storage depots and made available for use as fuel. |
| **Muscle Tissue (The "Pull")** | ERR Agonism & Fuel Oxidation | **SLU-PP-332** activates ERR receptors in muscle, reprogramming it to preferentially take up and burn the fatty acids that 5-Amino-1MQ has released. It increases the muscle's metabolic machinery (mitochondria) to handle this increased fuel supply. | A powerful and specific utilization of the mobilized fat. The muscle tissue acts like a metabolic sink, actively "pulling" fat from the bloodstream and incinerating it for energy. |
| **Systemic (The Net Effect)** | Body Composition & Metabolism | The **"Push"** from 5-Amino-1MQ and the **"Pull"** from SLU-PP-332 work in perfect concert. Fat has nowhere to go but to be burned by muscle. | A rapid and significant reduction in fat mass, preservation of lean muscle, and a profound improvement in overall metabolic health, effectively mimicking the effects of a rigorous diet and exercise program. |

## 4. Comprehensive Patient & Physician Guide

### 4.1 Detailed Patient Expectations & Timeline

| Timeframe | Subjective Experience | Physiological Changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Weeks 1-2** | An initial increase in energy levels and mental clarity. Some users report a mild thermogenic effect (feeling warmer) as metabolic rate increases. Appetite may be slightly reduced. | NNMT inhibition begins to increase NAD+ levels. Muscle gene expression starts to shift towards a fat-burning phenotype. |
| **Weeks 2-4** | Noticeable changes in body composition, even if weight on the scale doesn't change dramatically at first. A reduction in fat mass (e.g., waist circumference) and improved muscle definition are common. | Fatty acids are being mobilized from adipose tissue and oxidized in muscle at a significant rate. Mitochondrial density in muscle begins to increase. |
| **Months 1-3** | Significant reduction in body fat percentage and improvements in metabolic markers (lower triglycerides, improved insulin sensitivity). Increased endurance during physical activity. | The body has undergone a significant metabolic reprogramming. The fat-burning machinery is now highly efficient. |
| **Months 3-6+** | Achievement of body composition goals. A sustained state of high energy and metabolic efficiency. Long-term maintenance of a healthier, leaner physique. | A new, healthier metabolic set point is established, making it easier to maintain a lean body composition. |

### 4.2 Clinical Monitoring Recommendations

- **Body Composition:** Use of DEXA scan or bioimpedance analysis (e.g., InBody) at baseline and every 2-3 months to track changes in fat mass, lean mass, and body fat percentage.
- **Metabolic Panel:** Baseline and periodic monitoring of a lipid panel (triglycerides, HDL, LDL) and markers of insulin sensitivity (fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c).
- **Energy Levels:** Subjective tracking of energy levels, endurance, and recovery from exercise.

### 4.3 Dosing & Administration

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Timing:** Can be taken with or without food. Morning administration is often preferred to align with the body's natural metabolic rhythm.
- **Optimization:** The effects of M-51 are significantly amplified when combined with a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and a regular exercise program (particularly resistance training to maximize muscle preservation).

## 5. Safety & Drug Interaction Profile

- **Overall:** Both 5-Amino-1MQ and SLU-PP-332 are novel research compounds. Both have demonstrated favorable safety profiles in extensive preclinical studies with no significant adverse effects reported.
- **Absolute Contraindications:** Pregnancy and lactation; known hypersensitivity.
- **Tolerability:** Generally expected to be very well-tolerated based on preclinical data.

### 5.1 Drug Interaction Matrix

| Drug/Class | Interacting Component(s) | Clinical Consideration & Management |
|---|---|---|
| **N/A** | 5-Amino-1MQ, SLU-PP-332 | No significant drug interactions have been identified in preclinical studies. However, as these are novel compounds, caution is advised when co-administering with other medications until human data becomes available. Particular attention should be paid to other metabolic agents. |
