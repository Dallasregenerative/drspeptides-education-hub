# Patient Education Handout: Peptide Therapy

**What You Need to Know**

## What Are Peptides?

Peptides are short chains of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that act as signaling molecules in your body. They can influence various biological processes including:

- Tissue repair and healing
- Hormone production
- Immune function
- Metabolism and weight management
- Cognitive function
- Aging processes

## How to Administer Your Peptide

### Storage
- **Refrigerate** at 36-46°F (2-8°C) at all times
- Do NOT freeze
- Protect from light (keep in original packaging or amber vial)
- Discard after ___________ days once reconstituted

### Reconstitution (Mixing) Instructions

**If your peptide comes as a powder:**

1. Wash hands thoroughly
2. Clean vial tops with alcohol swabs
3. Draw ___________ mL of bacteriostatic water into syringe
4. Inject water slowly down the side of the peptide vial (not directly onto powder)
5. Gently swirl (do NOT shake vigorously)
6. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until fully dissolved
7. Label vial with date and concentration

### Injection Instructions

**Your dose:** ___________ mL or ___________ units

**Injection site:** ☐ Abdomen ☐ Thigh ☐ Deltoid (arm)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Wash hands** thoroughly with soap and water
2. **Clean injection site** with alcohol swab (let dry 30 seconds)
3. **Draw medication** from vial:
   - Remove cap from needle
   - Insert needle into vial
   - Turn vial upside down
   - Pull plunger to draw correct dose
   - Check for air bubbles (tap syringe and push air out)
4. **Inject medication:**
   - Pinch skin to create a fold
   - Insert needle at 45-90 degree angle (subcutaneous) or 90 degrees (intramuscular)
   - Push plunger slowly and steadily
   - Remove needle quickly
   - Apply gentle pressure with alcohol swab (do NOT rub)
5. **Dispose of needle** in sharps container (never recap)

### Site Rotation

**Why it matters:** Rotating injection sites prevents scar tissue buildup and improves absorption.

**Rotation pattern:**
- Divide abdomen into 4 quadrants (avoid 2 inches around belly button)
- Use different quadrant each injection
- Stay at least 1 inch away from previous injection site
- Avoid areas with bruising, redness, or lumps

## Dosing Schedule

**Frequency:** ☐ Daily ☐ 2x/day ☐ 3x/week ☐ 2x/week ☐ Other: ___________

**Best time to inject:** ___________________________

**Set reminders:** Use phone alarms or medication reminder apps

**If you miss a dose:**
- Take it as soon as you remember (if within 12 hours)
- If close to next dose, skip missed dose
- Do NOT double up doses

**Week 12:** Office visit + comprehensive labs  
**Week 24:** Office visit + labs

### Labs You'll Need

Your healthcare provider will order specific lab tests to monitor your response and safety. These may include:

- Blood tests (metabolic panel, blood count, etc.)
- Hormone levels (if applicable)
- Other tests based on your specific peptide and condition

**Fasting required:** ☐ Yes (_____ hours) ☐ No

### Nutrition
- Adequate protein: 0.8-1.0 g per pound of body weight
- Hydration: 8-10 glasses of water daily
- Minimize processed foods and added sugars
- Consider anti-inflammatory diet

### Exercise
- Regular physical activity (as appropriate for your condition)
- Resistance training 2-3x/week (if applicable)
- Adequate rest between workouts

### Sleep
- Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Optimize sleep environment (dark, cool, quiet)

### Stress Management

## Safety Considerations

### Contraindications

**Do NOT use peptides if you:**
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Have active cancer (without oncologist approval)

### Drug Interactions

**Tell your provider about ALL medications, including:**
- Prescription medications
- Over-the-counter medications
- Supplements and vitamins
- Herbal products

### Important Notes

- Peptides are often used "off-label" (not FDA-approved for your specific condition)
- Evidence varies by peptide (some have extensive research, others are newer)
- Individual results may vary
- Peptide therapy is part of a comprehensive treatment plan (not a standalone solution)
