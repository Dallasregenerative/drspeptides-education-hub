### Mechanism of Action
- Stimulates blood vessel and nerve outgrowth
- Increases collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycan synthesis
- Supports dermal fibroblast function
- Modulates 31.2% of human genes (increases 59%, suppresses 41%)
- Regulates metalloproteinases and anti-proteases

### Clinical Benefits
- Tightens loose skin and reverses thinning
- Repairs protective skin barrier proteins
- Improves firmness, elasticity, and clarity
- Reduces fine lines and wrinkles
- Smooths rough skin
- Reduces photodamage and hyperpigmentation
- Stimulates wound healing
- Protects from UV radiation
- Reduces inflammation and free radical damage
- Increases hair growth and thickness

### Pharmacokinetics
- Plasma level at age 20: ~200 ng/mL
- Plasma level at age 60: ~80 ng/mL
- Released from collagen during tissue injury

### Clinical Study Results
- 12-week facial cream study (71 women): Increased skin density/thickness, reduced laxity, improved clarity, reduced wrinkles
- Eye cream study (41 women): Reduced lines/wrinkles, improved appearance, increased skin density
- Thigh skin study: Improved collagen production in 70% of women

### Safety Profile
- Naturally occurring human peptide
- Present in plasma and released during injury
- Well-tolerated in clinical studies
- Multiple protective actions (anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, DNA repair)
