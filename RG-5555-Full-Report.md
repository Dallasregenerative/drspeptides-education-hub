## 1. COMPOSITION & OVERVIEW

Formula RG-5555 is a comprehensive, multi-pathway healing and recovery protocol. It combines four powerful peptides that work synergistically to accelerate tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and support gut health.

| Component | Dosage | Primary Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **BPC-157** | 500 mcg | Angiogenic & Growth Factor Modulation; "Body Protection Compound" |
| **TB-500** | 500 mcg | Actin-Sequestering Peptide; Thymosin Beta-4 Fragment |
| **KPV** | 500 mcg | Anti-inflammatory Tripeptide; α-MSH Fragment |
| **Larazotide** | 500 mcg | Zonulin Antagonist; Tight Junction Regulator |

This formulation provides a robust framework for systemic healing, addressing everything from acute injuries to chronic inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction.

## 2. DETAILED MECHANISM OF ACTION

Formula RG-5555 leverages four distinct but complementary mechanisms to promote healing.

### 2.1 BPC-157: Systemic Tissue Repair

BPC-157 is a stable gastric pentadecapeptide with powerful protective and regenerative effects across a wide range of tissues. It is thought to be a novel mediator of Robert’s cytoprotection, modulating growth factors and promoting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) [1].

- **Angiogenesis:** BPC-157 upregulates the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), a key signaling protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, which is critical for delivering nutrients and oxygen to injured tissues.
- **Growth Factor Modulation:** It interacts with multiple growth factor pathways, including Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), to accelerate the repair of tendons, ligaments, muscle, and bone.

### 2.2 TB-500: Cellular Migration & Differentiation

TB-500 is the synthetic version of Thymosin Beta-4, a naturally occurring peptide that plays a vital role in tissue repair. Its primary mechanism is the upregulation of actin, a protein critical for cell structure and movement [2].

- **Actin Upregulation:** By promoting actin production, TB-500 facilitates the migration of stem cells and progenitor cells to the site of injury, where they can differentiate into the specific cell types needed for repair.
- **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** It also reduces inflammation by downregulating inflammatory cytokines, creating a more favorable environment for healing.

### 2.3 KPV: Potent Anti-Inflammatory Action

KPV (Lys-Pro-Val) is the C-terminal fragment of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory agents found in the body. It works by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor that drives the inflammatory response [3].

- **NF-κB Inhibition:** By preventing NF-κB from entering the nucleus, KPV blocks the production of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, effectively shutting down the inflammatory cascade at its source.

### 2.4 Larazotide: Gut Barrier Restoration

Larazotide is a synthetic peptide that acts as a zonulin antagonist. Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of the tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells. In conditions like celiac disease and leaky gut syndrome, zonulin levels are elevated, leading to increased intestinal permeability.

- **Zonulin Antagonism:** Larazotide prevents zonulin from binding to its receptor, which helps to restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier [4]. A healthy gut barrier is critical for preventing systemic inflammation and supporting overall health.

### 2.5 Synergistic Architecture

The four peptides in RG-5555 work in a coordinated sequence. BPC-157 and TB-500 provide the direct stimulus for tissue repair and cell migration. KPV creates the optimal low-inflammation environment for this repair to occur efficiently. Larazotide addresses a common root cause of systemic inflammation—a compromised gut barrier—thereby reducing the overall inflammatory load on the body and allowing the other peptides to work more effectively.

## 3. CLINICAL INDICATIONS & BENEFITS

Formula RG-5555 is indicated for individuals with acute or chronic injuries, inflammatory conditions, and gut-related health issues.

| Category | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| **Tissue Repair & Recovery** | Accelerated healing of tendons, ligaments, muscle, and bone; faster recovery from surgery or injury. |
| **Anti-Inflammatory** | Potent reduction of both acute and chronic inflammation; relief from inflammatory pain. |
| **Gut Health** | Restoration of intestinal barrier integrity; reduction of symptoms associated with leaky gut syndrome. |
| **Systemic Wellness** | Reduced systemic inflammation; improved immune function; overall enhancement of the body's healing capacity. |

## 4. DOSING, ADMINISTRATION & SAFETY

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Administration:** Can be taken with or without food.
- **Safety Profile:** All four peptides have demonstrated excellent safety profiles in preclinical and/or clinical studies. BPC-157 and TB-500 are widely used in regenerative medicine with few reported side effects. KPV is an endogenous peptide fragment. Larazotide has been through Phase 3 clinical trials for celiac disease and was found to be safe and well-tolerated.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy/lactation; known hypersensitivity.
