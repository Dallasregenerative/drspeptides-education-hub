**PHYSICIAN USE ONLY | RESEARCH PEPTIDES**

*Last Updated: February 5, 2026*

---

## 1. Composition & Overview

**Formula Classification:** Multi-pathway regenerative and anti-inflammatory protocol – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**
- BPC-157 – 500 mcg
- TB-500 – 500 mcg
- KPV – 500 mcg
- Larazotide – 500 mcg

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for daily use, designed to protect peptide integrity and ensure optimal absorption for systemic effects.

**Therapeutic Intent:**
- To provide a comprehensive, multi-system healing and recovery solution by simultaneously targeting four critical pathways: tissue repair and angiogenesis (BPC-157, TB-500), inflammation modulation (KPV), and gastrointestinal barrier integrity (Larazotide). This formula is designed for accelerated recovery from injury, surgery, and chronic inflammatory states.

## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

Formula RG-5555 integrates four synergistic peptides that together orchestrate a powerful, multi-faceted healing response.

### 2.1 BPC-157: Systemic Tissue Repair

BPC-157 is a master healing peptide that modulates growth factors and promotes angiogenesis, accelerating the repair of tendon, ligament, muscle, and bone [1].

### 2.2 TB-500: Cellular Migration & Differentiation

TB-500, a synthetic version of Thymosin Beta-4, promotes the migration of stem cells to the site of injury and reduces inflammation, creating a favorable environment for healing [2].

### 2.3 KPV: Potent Anti-Inflammatory Action

KPV is a powerful anti-inflammatory peptide that inhibits NF-κB, a master regulator of the inflammatory response, effectively shutting down the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [3].

### 2.4 Larazotide: Gut Barrier Restoration

Larazotide is a zonulin antagonist that restores the integrity of the intestinal barrier, reducing systemic inflammation caused by a "leaky gut" [4].

## 3. Synergistic Integration Table

| Level | Primary Pathway | Key Components | Integrated Clinical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundational | Gut Barrier Integrity & Systemic Inflammation | Larazotide, KPV | Reduces the overall inflammatory burden, allowing for more efficient healing. |
| Local Environment | Anti-inflammation & Cell Migration | KPV, TB-500 | Creates an optimal, low-inflammation environment at the site of injury and attracts healing cells. |
| Structural Repair | Angiogenesis & Tissue Regeneration | BPC-157, TB-500 | Provides the direct stimulus for building new blood vessels and repairing damaged tissue. |

## 4. Key Clinical Benefits

| Domain | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| Musculoskeletal | Accelerated healing of injuries; reduced pain and inflammation; improved joint function. |
| Post-Surgical | Faster wound healing; minimized scar tissue; reduced post-operative pain. |
| Gastrointestinal | Restoration of gut barrier integrity; reduction of symptoms associated with leaky gut and IBD. |
| Systemic Wellness | Reduced chronic inflammation; enhanced recovery from exercise; improved overall resilience. |

---

## 5. Patient Expectations & Timeline

| Timeframe | Expected Changes |
|---|---|
| 1-7 Days | Initial reduction in pain and inflammation; improved digestive comfort. |
| 1-2 Weeks | Significant improvement in recovery from injury or exercise; further reduction in inflammation. |
| 2-4 Weeks | Accelerated tissue healing with measurable improvements in function and strength. |
| 1-3 Months | Substantial to complete resolution of acute injuries; significant improvement in chronic conditions. |

## 6. Dosing & Administration

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Timing:** Can be taken with or without food. Consistent daily timing is recommended.
- **Optimization:** Combine with a nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory diet to maximize benefits.

---

## 7. Safety Profile

- **Overall:** Excellent safety profile. All four peptides are well-tolerated with extensive preclinical and/or clinical data.
- **Absolute Contraindications:** Pregnancy and lactation; active malignancy (theoretical concern with angiogenic effects).
- **Tolerability:** Generally very well-tolerated with minimal side effects.

## 8. Drug Interaction Considerations

| Drug/Class | Interaction / Management |
|---|---|
| Immunosuppressants | Potential for competing effects; requires medical supervision. |
| Anticoagulants | Theoretical increased bleeding risk with TB-500; monitor closely. |
