## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

### 2.1 BPC-157 – The Body's Protective Compound

BPC-157 is a synthetic peptide composed of 15 amino acids, derived from a protein found in the stomach. It is renowned for its potent cytoprotective and healing properties. BPC-157 accelerates the healing of a wide variety of tissues, including muscle, tendon, ligament, bone, and nerve. Its mechanisms of action are multifaceted and include the upregulation of growth hormone receptors, enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and promotion of angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). BPC-157 also exhibits strong anti-inflammatory effects and provides significant gastrointestinal protection, making it effective in the treatment of ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and leaky gut syndrome.

### 2.2 TB-500 – The Regenerative Peptide

TB-500 is a synthetic version of Thymosin Beta-4, a naturally occurring peptide found in virtually all human and animal cells. TB-500 plays a crucial role in tissue repair and regeneration. Its primary mechanism of action is its ability to bind to actin, a key protein in cell structure and movement. By sequestering G-actin, TB-500 promotes cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, which are essential processes for wound healing. TB-500 also has potent anti-inflammatory properties, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting a pro-healing environment. It has been shown to accelerate the healing of muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries, as well as to promote hair growth and reduce scar formation.

### 2.3 KPV – The Anti-inflammatory Tripeptide

KPV is a tripeptide (Lysine-Proline-Valine) that is a C-terminal fragment of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). It is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that works by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB. KPV also modulates immune responses, promoting a shift from a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 response to a more anti-inflammatory Th2/Treg response. This makes it particularly effective in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including IBD, psoriasis, and uveitis. KPV also supports gut barrier function and has been shown to be effective in both systemic and topical applications.

### 2.4 Larazotide – The Gut Barrier Stabilizer

Larazotide is an octapeptide that acts as a zonulin antagonist. Zonulin is a protein that regulates the permeability of the tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells. In conditions such as celiac disease, IBD, and leaky gut syndrome, zonulin levels are elevated, leading to increased intestinal permeability and the passage of undigested food particles, toxins, and pathogens into the bloodstream. Larazotide works by blocking the action of zonulin, thereby stabilizing the tight junctions and restoring the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This reduces inflammation, improves nutrient absorption, and alleviates the symptoms associated with increased intestinal permeability.
