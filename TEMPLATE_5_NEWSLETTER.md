**Example:**

### 🔬 Clinical Pearl: BPC-157 Reduces GLP-1 Nausea

**The Insight:**  
BPC-157's gastroprotective effects may mitigate the most common adverse effect of GLP-1 agonists: nausea and vomiting.

**The Evidence:**  
Animal studies demonstrate BPC-157's ability to protect gastric mucosa, accelerate ulcer healing, and modulate the gut-brain axis. While human data is limited, practitioners report 50-70% reduction in GI side effects when combining BPC-157 with semaglutide or tirzepatide.  
📚 [BPC-157 gastroprotection: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/...]

**How to Apply:**
- Dosing: BPC-157 250-500 mcg SC daily, starting with GLP-1 initiation
- Timing: Morning dose (or split AM/PM if 500 mcg total)
- Monitoring: GI symptom score weekly during titration
- Expected outcome: Reduced nausea severity and faster GLP-1 titration

**Clinical Consideration:**  
Best for patients with GI sensitivity or those who failed previous GLP-1 trials due to nausea.

- [Finding 2 with specific data]
- [Finding 3 with specific data]

**Clinical Implications:**  
[2-3 sentences on how this changes or informs practice]

**Limitations:**  
[1-2 sentences on study limitations]

**Read the full study:** [PubMed link]

**Example:**

### 📊 New Research: Retatrutide Achieves 24% Weight Loss at 48 Weeks

**Study Overview:**  
Phase 2 trial of retatrutide (GIP/GLP-1/glucagon triple agonist) in 338 adults with obesity. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design comparing 1mg, 4mg, 8mg, and 12mg weekly doses.

**Key Findings:**
- 24.2% weight loss with 12mg dose at 48 weeks (vs. 2.1% placebo)
- 91% of participants achieved ≥5% weight loss (vs. 13% placebo)
- Adverse events: nausea (33%), diarrhea (21%), vomiting (17%) - mostly mild-moderate

**Clinical Implications:**  
Retatrutide represents the most effective weight loss peptide to date, surpassing tirzepatide's 22% loss. The triple agonist mechanism (adding glucagon) may enhance metabolic rate and energy expenditure beyond GLP-1/GIP alone.

**Limitations:**  
Phase 2 data only; Phase 3 trials ongoing. Long-term safety and cardiovascular outcomes pending.

**Example:**

### 💊 Protocol Spotlight: Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy

**Patient Profile:**  
Active adults with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (>3 months) who have failed conservative management (PT, eccentric exercises, NSAIDs).

**Protocol:**

**Primary Peptide:**
- Peptide: BPC-157
- Dose: 500 mcg SC daily
- Frequency: Daily for 8-12 weeks
- Duration: Reassess at 8 weeks; continue if improving

**Adjunct Peptide:**
- Peptide: TB-500
- Dose: 5 mg SC twice weekly
- Rationale: Synergistic anti-fibrotic and tissue remodeling effects

**Monitoring:**
- Baseline: VAS pain scale, ROM, functional assessment
- Week 2: Pain scale (phone check-in)
- Week 4: Pain scale, ROM, CRP
- Week 8: Pain scale, ROM, CRP, functional assessment
- Week 12: Consider ultrasound or MRI if available

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Timeline: 50% pain reduction by week 4-6; functional improvement by week 8-12
- Success metrics: VAS pain ↓ by ≥50%, ROM improvement, return to activity

**Troubleshooting:**
- If no response by week 8: Consider PRP, shockwave therapy, or surgical consultation
- If adverse effects: Rare; injection site reactions managed with site rotation

## Section 4: Q&A from Practitioners

**Format:** Answer a common practitioner question

**Template:**

### ❓ Practitioner Q&A

**Q: [Practitioner question]**

**A:** [Comprehensive answer with evidence and practical guidance - 3-5 sentences]

**Key Takeaway:** [1 sentence summary]

---

**Example:**

### ❓ Practitioner Q&A

**Q: Can I combine multiple growth hormone secretagogues (CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin + GHRP-2) for enhanced effects?**

**A:** While combining GH secretagogues can amplify GH release, excessive stacking increases adverse effects (joint pain, fluid retention, insulin resistance) without proportional benefits. The most evidence-supported combination is CJC-1295 (no DAC) + Ipamorelin, which provides synergistic pulsatile GH release while minimizing cortisol/prolactin spikes. Adding a third secretagogue (GHRP-2/6) rarely enhances outcomes and complicates monitoring. If inadequate response to dual therapy, consider dose optimization or addressing lifestyle factors (sleep, stress, nutrition) before adding more peptides.

**Key Takeaway:** Stick with CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin; more is not always better.
