**Peptide Name(s):** ___________________________

**Indication/Purpose:** ___________________________

**Dosing:** ___________________________

**Duration:** ___________________________

## Understanding Peptide Therapy

### What Are Peptides?

Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as signaling molecules in the body. They can influence various biological processes including tissue repair, hormone production, immune function, metabolism, and aging.

### Regulatory Status

**I understand that:**

☐ Many peptides are NOT FDA-approved for the condition being treated (off-label use)

☐ Some peptides are investigational and have limited human safety data

☐ FDA-approved peptides (if applicable): ___________________________

☐ Off-label peptides (if applicable): ___________________________

☐ The evidence supporting peptide use varies:
  - Some have robust clinical trial data
  - Some have animal studies and case reports
  - Some have primarily mechanistic/theoretical support

---

## Potential Benefits

**Based on available evidence, potential benefits may include:**

☐ Improved tissue healing and repair  
☐ Enhanced recovery from injury  
☐ Weight loss and metabolic improvement  
☐ Improved body composition (lean mass ↑, fat mass ↓)  
☐ Cognitive enhancement  
☐ Immune system support  
☐ Anti-aging effects  
☐ Other: ___________________________

**Expected timeline for benefits:** ___________________________

**I understand that:**
- Individual results vary significantly
- Benefits are not guaranteed
- Some patients may not respond to therapy
- Optimal results require lifestyle optimization (nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management)

## Potential Risks & Side Effects

### Common Side Effects (Usually Mild)

☐ Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain)  
☐ Nausea or gastrointestinal discomfort  
☐ Headache  
☐ Fatigue or changes in energy  
☐ Fluid retention or mild edema  
☐ Joint discomfort  
☐ Other: ___________________________

### Serious Adverse Events (Rare)

☐ Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)  
☐ Pancreatitis (for GLP-1 agonists)  
☐ Hypoglycemia (if combined with diabetes medications)  
☐ Thyroid concerns (theoretical for some peptides)  
☐ Cancer risk (theoretical concern with growth factors)  
☐ Cardiovascular events  
☐ Infection at injection site  
☐ Other: ___________________________

**I understand that:**
- Long-term safety data is limited for many peptides
- Unknown risks may exist
- I should report any adverse effects immediately
- Serious adverse events, while rare, can occur

## Monitoring Requirements

**I understand that peptide therapy requires regular monitoring:**

### Laboratory Testing
☐ Baseline labs before starting therapy  
☐ Follow-up labs at weeks 4, 12, and 24 (or as specified)  
☐ Additional labs if adverse effects occur  
☐ Specific tests may include: blood counts, metabolic panels, hormone levels, inflammatory markers

### Clinical Assessments
☐ Regular office visits for symptom review and physical examination  
☐ Vital sign monitoring (blood pressure, heart rate, weight)  
☐ Functional assessments (pain scales, range of motion, cognitive testing, etc.)  
☐ Imaging studies if indicated

### Patient Responsibilities
☐ Attend all scheduled appointments  
☐ Complete all required lab work  
☐ Report any adverse effects promptly  
☐ Maintain symptom diary or tracking log

**I understand that:**
- Monitoring is essential for safety and efficacy
