## Mechanism of Action

### Triple-Pathway Cognitive Enhancement:

- **Dihexa (Neurogenic Pathways):**
  - A highly potent angiotensin IV analog that acts as a c-Met receptor agonist, promoting synaptogenesis and the development of new neural connections. It is several orders of magnitude more potent than Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and creates lasting structural changes in the brain to enhance memory and learning.

- **Tesofensine (Neurotransmitter Optimization):**
  - A triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, preventing the reabsorption of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This optimizes the balance of key neurotransmitters involved in focus, motivation, and mood. It also provides potent appetite suppression and metabolic benefits.

- **Methylene Blue (Mitochondrial Enhancement):**
  - Acts as an alternative electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, enhancing cellular energy (ATP) production and reducing oxidative stress. It provides neuroprotective effects and optimizes cognitive function, particularly at low doses.

**Synergistic Effects:** The combination of Dihexa’s neurogenic properties, Tesofensine’s neurotransmitter optimization, and Methylene Blue’s mitochondrial enhancement provides a multi-level approach to cognitive enhancement that surpasses the effects of any single agent.

## Scientific Evidence

**Evidence Level: HIGH** - Individual components are extensively studied with clear mechanistic understanding.

**Key Research Highlights:**
1. Dihexa has been shown to be seven orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF for synaptic enhancement.
2. Tesofensine demonstrated 9.2% weight loss in Phase II clinical trials.
3. Methylene blue has been shown to improve brain connectivity and memory function in human studies.
