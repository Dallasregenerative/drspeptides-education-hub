## Mechanism of Action

### Triple-Pathway Cognitive Enhancement:

**Dihexa (Neurotropic Pathway):**
- Potentiates hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activity at c-Met receptors, the primary neurotropic signaling pathway for synaptogenesis.
- Seven orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF for neurotrophic activity—picomolar concentrations produce robust synaptic enhancement.
- Promotes synaptogenesis and hippocampal spinogenesis, creating lasting structural brain improvements.
- Enhances spatial memory formation, cognitive flexibility, and learning capacity.
- Creates lasting structural connectivity improvements that persist beyond active treatment.

**Tesofensine (Neurotransmitter Optimization):**
- Triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor blocking dopamine (DAT: 8.0 nM), norepinephrine (NET: 3.2 nM), and serotonin (SERT: 11.0 nM) transporters.
- High-affinity inhibition optimizes neurotransmitter balance for focus, motivation, and mood stability.
- Proven appetite suppression with 9.2% weight loss in Phase II clinical trials—metabolic benefits complement cognitive enhancement.
- 9-day half-life provides sustained, stable effects without peaks and troughs.
- Enhances executive function, attention, and cognitive stamina.

**Methylene Blue (Mitochondrial Enhancement):**
- Alternative electron carrier in mitochondrial transport chain, bypassing Complex I and III deficiencies.
- Enhances cellular ATP production by 10-30% in neurons, providing the energy substrate for cognitive function.
- Reduces oxidative stress through direct antioxidant activity and enhanced mitochondrial efficiency.
- Provides neuroprotective effects against age-related decline and neurodegenerative processes.
- Optimal cognitive benefits at low doses (0.5-4 mg/kg)—hormetic dose-response curve.

**Synergistic Integration:** Dihexa builds neural infrastructure through synaptogenesis, Tesofensine optimizes neurotransmitter function across this enhanced network, and Methylene Blue ensures optimal cellular energy for sustained cognitive performance. This multi-level approach creates comprehensive cognitive enhancement exceeding single-agent approaches.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Take consistently at the same time daily for stable neurotransmitter levels.
- Ensure adequate hydration (2-3 liters daily).
- Monitor cognitive response and adjust timing if needed.
- Combine with cognitive training, learning activities, or demanding mental work for enhanced neuroplastic benefits.
- Avoid late-day dosing to prevent sleep interference.
