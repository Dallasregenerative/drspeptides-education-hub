## 1. COMPOSITION & OVERVIEW

Formula N-2331 is a four-component protocol designed for comprehensive neuro-cognitive enhancement and metabolic support. It combines powerful nootropic peptides with a fundamental coenzyme to boost brain function, protect against neurodegeneration, and enhance cellular energy.

| Component | Dosage | Primary Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Dihexa** | 2 mg | HGF/c-Met System Activation & Structural Synaptogenesis |
| **Selank** | 0.3 mg | Anxiolytic & Immunomodulatory Peptide; Tuftsin Analog |
| **Semax** | 0.3 mg | Nootropic & Neuroprotective Peptide; ACTH(4-10) Analog |
| **NAD+** | 100 mg | Essential Coenzyme for Redox Reactions & Cellular Energy |

This formulation targets cognitive function from multiple angles: structural plasticity, anxiety reduction, neurotrophic support, and fundamental metabolic energy.

## 2. DETAILED MECHANISM OF ACTION

Formula N-2331 integrates four distinct but synergistic pathways for cognitive enhancement.

### 2.1 Dihexa: Structural Synaptogenesis

Dihexa is a potent, blood-brain barrier-permeable peptide that activates the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling system. This pathway is critical for the formation of new synapses (synaptogenesis), promoting the structural plasticity required for learning and memory [1]. By enhancing the brain's ability to form new connections, Dihexa provides the physical foundation for improved cognitive function.

### 2.2 Selank: Anxiolytic & Neurotrophic Support

Selank is a synthetic analog of the immunomodulatory peptide tuftsin. It exhibits potent anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects without the sedative or cognitive-impairing side effects of traditional anxiolytics. 

- **Anxiolysis:** Selank modulates the expression of GABAergic neurons and balances the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters, leading to a reduction in stress and anxiety [2].
- **Neurotrophic Effects:** It has been shown to increase the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, a key molecule for neuroplasticity and neuronal survival [3].

By reducing anxiety, Selank creates an optimal neurochemical environment for cognitive function, allowing for clearer thought and better focus.

### 2.3 Semax: Nootropic & Neuroprotective Action

Semax is a synthetic analog of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and is one of the most well-researched nootropics. 

- **Neurotrophic Stimulation:** Semax significantly increases the expression of BDNF and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in the brain. This stimulation of neurotrophins enhances attention, memory formation, and neuronal resilience [4].
- **Neurotransmitter Modulation:** It modulates the activity of multiple neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin, which are crucial for attention, motivation, and mood.

### 2.4 NAD+: Fundamental Cellular Energy

Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical coenzyme found in every cell in the body. It is essential for the redox reactions that drive cellular metabolism and energy production (ATP). NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, and this decline is linked to age-related cognitive impairment.

- **Energy Production:** By supplementing NAD+, this formula ensures that neurons have the fundamental energy required to perform demanding cognitive tasks, build new synapses, and repair cellular damage [5].
- **Sirtuin Activation:** NAD+ is a required substrate for sirtuins, a class of proteins that regulate cellular health, DNA repair, and inflammation. Activating sirtuins has neuroprotective effects.

### 2.5 Synergistic Architecture

The components of N-2331 work in a coordinated fashion. Dihexa builds the new neural pathways. Selank and Semax optimize the neurochemical environment and stimulate the brain's own repair and growth factors (BDNF/NGF). NAD+ provides the raw energy to fuel all of these processes. This creates a comprehensive system for enhancing cognitive function, from the structural level down to the fundamental metabolic level.

| Category | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| **Cognitive Enhancement** | Improved attention and focus; enhanced memory formation and recall; increased mental stamina. |
| **Mood & Anxiety** | Significant reduction in anxiety and stress without sedation; improved mood and sense of well-being. |
| **Neuroprotection** | Increased levels of BDNF and NGF; protection against age-related cognitive decline; enhanced neuronal resilience. |
| **Cellular Energy** | Increased NAD+ levels supporting mitochondrial function and ATP production; reduced mental fatigue. |

## 4. DOSING, ADMINISTRATION & SAFETY

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily.
- **Administration:** Can be taken with or without food. Morning administration is often preferred.
- **Safety Profile:** All components have a high degree of safety and are well-tolerated. Selank and Semax have been used clinically in Russia and Eastern Europe for years with excellent safety records. Dihexa has a favorable preclinical safety profile. NAD+ is a natural bodily substance.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy/lactation; known hypersensitivity.
