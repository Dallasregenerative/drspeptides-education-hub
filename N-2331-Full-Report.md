## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

### 2.1 Dihexa – Neoplastic Structural Enhancement

Dihexa is a highly potent, orally active, and blood-brain barrier-penetrating peptide that is an analog of Angiotensin IV. It acts as a specific agonist of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-Met. The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway is crucial for neuronal development, survival, and regeneration. Dihexa has been shown to be seven orders of magnitude more potent than brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in promoting synaptogenesis, the formation of new synapses between neurons. This leads to lasting structural changes in the brain, enhancing neural connectivity and plasticity. By promoting the growth of new dendrites and synapses, Dihexa can improve learning, memory consolidation, and recall. It has also been shown to enhance hippocampal function and spatial memory.

### 2.2 Selank – Anxiolytic & GABAergic Modulation

Selank is a synthetic analog of the endogenous peptide tuftsin. It is known for its anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) effects. Selank modulates the GABAergic system, enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA without causing the sedation or dependence associated with benzodiazepines. It also influences the expression of BDNF and other neurotrophic factors, contributing to its neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties. Selank has been shown to improve mood, reduce anxiety, and enhance cognitive function, particularly in a state of calm focus.

### 2.3 Semax – BDNF Upregulation & Neuroprotection

Semax is a synthetic peptide analog of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). It is a potent nootropic and neuroprotective agent. Semax increases the expression of BDNF and TrkB receptors in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, leading to enhanced synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity. It also modulates the activity of various neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin. Semax has been shown to improve attention, memory, and cognitive performance, particularly under conditions of stress or fatigue. It also exhibits potent antioxidant properties and reduces neuroinflammation, protecting the brain from ischemic and other forms of damage.

### 2.4 NAD+ – Metabolic Foundation & Cellular Energy

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical coenzyme found in every cell in the body. It is essential for cellular energy production (ATP) through its role in mitochondrial respiration. NAD+ is also a key substrate for several enzymes, including sirtuins and PARPs (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerases), which are involved in DNA repair, inflammation, and cellular aging. NAD+ levels decline with age, and this decline is associated with a wide range of age-related diseases. Supplementation with NAD+ can help to restore cellular energy levels, enhance DNA repair, and support overall health and longevity.
