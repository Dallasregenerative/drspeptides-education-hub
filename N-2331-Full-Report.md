## 1. Composition & Overview

**Formula Classification:** Multi-pathway neuro-regenerative and metabolic protocol – enteric-coated research capsule designed for physician-directed use only.

**Per Capsule Composition:**
- Dihexa – 2 mg
- Selank – 0.3 mg
- Semax – 0.3 mg
- NAD+ – 100 mg

**Delivery System:**
- Enteric-coated oral capsule for daily use, designed to protect peptide integrity and ensure optimal absorption.

**Therapeutic Intent:**
- To provide a comprehensive, four-pronged approach to cognitive enhancement by targeting structural plasticity (Dihexa), anxiety reduction (Selank), neurotrophic support (Semax), and fundamental cellular energy (NAD+). This formula is designed for individuals seeking to improve focus, memory, and mental clarity while simultaneously supporting long-term brain health and resilience.

## 2. Detailed Mechanism of Action

Formula N-2331 integrates four synergistic components to create a powerful nootropic and neuroprotective stack.

### 2.1 Dihexa: Structural Synaptogenesis

Dihexa activates the HGF/c-Met pathway, a critical system for neuronal growth and repair, promoting the formation of new synapses and enhancing the brain's structural capacity for learning and memory [1].

### 2.2 Selank: Anxiolytic & Neurotrophic Support

Selank is a potent anxiolytic that reduces stress and anxiety without sedation. It also increases the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a key molecule for neuroplasticity [2, 3].

### 2.3 Semax: Nootropic & Neuroprotective Action

Semax is a well-researched nootropic that significantly increases the expression of both BDNF and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), enhancing attention, memory, and neuronal resilience [4].

### 2.4 NAD+: Fundamental Cellular Energy

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme for cellular energy production (ATP) and a required substrate for sirtuin longevity pathways. Supplementing NAD+ provides neurons with the energy needed for cognitive tasks and cellular repair [5].

## 5. Patient Expectations & Timeline

| Timeframe | Expected Changes |
|---|---|
| 1-3 Days | Initial increase in mental clarity and focus; noticeable reduction in anxiety. |
| 1-2 Weeks | More consistent cognitive enhancement; improved memory and learning capacity. |
| 1-3 Months | Significant improvements in overall cognitive function, mood, and stress resilience. |
| 3-6+ Months | Long-term consolidation of cognitive gains and enhanced brain health. |

## 6. Dosing & Administration

- **Standard Dose:** One capsule daily, typically in the morning.
- **Timing:** Consistent daily use is recommended for optimal long-term benefits.
- **Optimization:** Can be cycled (e.g., 5 days on, 2 days off) to maintain sensitivity.

## 7. Safety Profile

- **Overall:** Excellent safety profile. Selank and Semax have a long history of clinical use with no significant side effects. Dihexa and NAD+ are also well-tolerated.
- **Absolute Contraindications:** Pregnancy and lactation; known hypersensitivity.
- **Tolerability:** Generally very well-tolerated. Some users may experience mild, transient stimulation or headache, which typically resolves.
